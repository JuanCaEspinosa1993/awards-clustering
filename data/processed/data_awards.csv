2002362.xml,RUI:  Terpenes as Versatile Building Blocks for Multivalent Polymeric and Nanoparticle Systems,NSF,2020-06-01,2025-05-31,295200,"In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Peter M. Iovine of the Department of Chemistry at the University of San Diego is transforming terpene building blocks into sustainable polymers and nanoparticles. Terpenes are a large and diverse class of natural compounds, produced by a variety of plants (particularly conifers such as pine trees) and by some insects.  In this research, the team uses light to convert terpenes into defined nanostructures upon interaction with DNA. Structure-function relationships between these polymeric building blocks and the resultant nanoparticle stability, pH dependence and structure are determined.  The project has broader impact by providing scientifically robust training opportunities for undergraduate students. Participating students acquire diverse training in small molecule and polymer synthesis, characterization, and nanomaterials development. Elements of this research are also incorporated into existing chemistry courses at the University of San Diego. <br/><br/>This research is focused on the synthesis of new polymer and nanoparticle systems derived from terpenes. The innovation in the approach is two-fold. First, terpenes and terpene-containing polymers are synthetically modified such that the products display clusters of functional groups. These terpene-based building blocks are then assembled into defined nanostructures through ionic and/or non-covalent interactions leading to functional nanoparticles. The first thrust focuses on the creation of terpene-derived polycationic polymers and the complexation of these polymers by DNA to produce nanoparticles (polyplexes). The second thrust also starts with functional terpenes but focuses on polyborylation instead of polycationization. Once synthesized, polyborylated building blocks form complexes with Lewis basic polymers to produce a new class of boron-rich nanoparticles (boraplexes). The fundamental properties of terpene-derived. boron-rich nanoparticles are systematically investigated, and various factors that affect their assembly elucidated. This project has the potential to expand the utilization of terpenes as a sustainable chemical building block for polymer constructs and nanomaterials. The developed synthetic methodology could also impact development in application areas such as sustainable polyols, surfactants, coatings, and nanocomposites.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2001502.xml,Tropical and nonarchimedean analytic methods in algebraic geometry,NSF,2020-09-01,2024-08-31,359739,"Algebraic geometry studies solution sets of systems of polynomial equations.  For instance, lines are solution sets of linear polynomial equations, while circles and hyperbolas are solution sets to quadratic polynomial equations, and their study goes back to the ancient Greeks. The solution sets of systems of many polynomial equations in many variables often have beautiful and complicated geometry. The PI will apply new and modern techniques to answer questions of classical interest in the field of algebraic geometry, and to address long standing open problems about the geometry of curves defined by polynomial equations. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over a nonarchimedean field, one can split the problem of understanding such solution sets into two parts. What are the possible valuations of solutions?  And what are the solutions with a given valuation?  The set of valuations of solutions has a rich combinatorial and polyhedral structure, and is the primary object of study in tropical geometry; the solutions with a given valuation can be studied via nonarchimedean analytic geometry.  Recent developments in these fields make it possible to resolve subtle questions about the geometry of the actual solution set using new and innovative tools and techniques. This project will refine, abstract, and generalize these new methods and explore deeper applications to open problems in algebraic geometry.The PI will use tropical and nonarchimedean methods to continue his work on refined curve counting, and on unstable cohomology of moduli spaces of curves, proceeding beyond the top graded piece of the weight filtration to examine the full weight-graded cohomology ring. He will also initiate an analogous study of the weight graded cohomology of the moduli space of abelian varieties, using the topology of moduli spaces of tropical abelian varieties and the combinatorial algebra of complexes built out of unimodular matroids and perfect quadratic forms. Additional projects will attack the motivic, p-adic, and topological monodromy conjectures for Newton nondegenerate singularities, using the combinatorics of relative local h-polynomials and Stapledon’s formulas for monodromy, and attempt to resolve outstanding (and mutually contradictory) conjectures of Kontsevich and Morita in the homology of commutative graph complexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002922.xml,Pendant Photochromic Switches Enabling Fluxional Macromolecular Pi-Electronics,NSF,2020-07-01,2023-06-30,600000,"With this award, the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry is funding Professors John D. Tovar and Arthur E. Bragg of the Department of Chemistry at Johns Hopkins University to understand how pi-conjugated building blocks with fluxional electronic structures driven by light absorption can tune the properties of organic electronic materials.  Organic electronics can impact many areas of contemporary energy and electrical science, with innovations on the horizon in fields such as large-area lighting, energy storage, and even biomedicine.  These materials are essentially long chain plastic-like molecules but with unusual electronic properties imparted through special bonds called pi-bonds.  The alternation of pi-bonds with single bonds enables the molecules or polymers to conduct electricity when these bonds are varied.  In this research, the investigators first construct molecular building blocks for the polymers with different electronic properties.  Computational modelling is utilized to systematically investigate how chemical changes introduced into the building blocks affect the overall properties of the polymers from which they are formed.  Advanced spectroscopic and electrical measurement techniques are used to understand changes in electronic and molecular structures in real time.  Such systematic investigations generate knowledge that could lead to significant improvements in cutting-edge applications ranging from high-speed transistors to energy storage.  Students associated with this project are exposed to interdisciplinary research and prepared to be leaders in the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists.  Education and outreach activities targeting students and underrepresented minority groups in urban Baltimore high schools provide additional creative opportunities for broader community involvement.<br/><br/>This work is focused on the exploration of organic electronic materials derived from complex aromatic structures as components of photoswitchable conjugated polymers.  The research plan involves the synthesis of photoswitchable fluxional monomer units triggered by various external stimuli and extensions to oligomeric and polymeric analogues, computational modeling to understand how these chemical changes impact electronic properties, and spectroscopic interrogations using steady-state and ultrafast or other time-resolved techniques to capture changes in electronic and molecular structure.  The general research approach is primarily concerned with new strategies to achieve highly polarizable polymer electronic structures as opposed to particular bandgap engineering of energy levels. The ideas elucidated from this project could be transitioned to many types of application-specific materials designs such as stimuli-switchable transistors whereby conjugation pathways can be controlled externally.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000391.xml,Development of More Active and More Selective Catalysts for ATRP,NSF,2020-09-01,2024-08-31,600000,"With this award, the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program in the Chemistry Division is supporting Professor Krzysztof Matyjaszewski at Carnegie Mellon University to develop new Cu-based catalysts for atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Radical polymerization is a chemical reaction that sequentially adds small molecules of monomers to form long polymer chains that consist of hundreds or thousands of repeating units. This powerful synthetic method is used to make nearly half of all plastics, about 100 million tons worldwide each year. ATRP is a special type of radical polymerization that can prepare advanced polymers with precisely controlled chain lengths and shapes. ATRP is also used to prepare various hybrid materials by chemically linking synthetic polymers to biomolecules and to surfaces of inorganic particles. Professor Matyjaszewski’s team develops new catalysts for such important ATRP processes with enhanced activity and selectivity. This study will contribute to the creation of more precise polymers and expansion of range of polymerizable monomers, while using diminished levels of catalyst. By employing “green” ATRP catalysts, this research provides environmentally improved polymerization conditions, relevant for the industrial production of polymers. The broader impacts include the training undergraduate and graduate students in polymer science and educating the public about controlled radical polymerization via instructional webpages and videos.<br/><br/>Under this ward, Professor Matyjaszewski and his  team will explore preparation of catalysts with much higher activity than the original ATRP catalysts and that retain selectivity for the ATRP pathway while suppressing Cu-induced termination and transfer reactions. ATRP is based on a reversible atom transfer process between dormant alkyl halides and growing radicals, catalyzed by redox active transition metal complexes. ATRP is used to prepare advanced polymers with well-defined architecture. They include uniform linear chains and also star, comb and cyclic polymers, as well as statistical, periodic, gradient and block copolymers. The new ATRP catalysts are based on ligands belonging to the tris(pyridylmetyl)amine, or tetra-aza-macrocycle families. Thermodynamic and kinetic properties of new complexes will be determined through electrochemical, spectroscopic and computational methods to establish the comprehensive structure/reactivity relationship. The new catalysts being developed will be employed for ATRP of (meth)acrylates and (meth)acrylamides and also for less ATRP-active monomers such as vinyl esters and N-vinylamides. The catalysts will be evaluated for their ability to activate alkyl (pseudo)halides with F-C, N3-C, SCN-C bonds, much less active species than the alkyl bromides or chlorides that are typically used in ATRP. The extremely reactive Cu-based catalysts react not only with alkyl halides but also with propagating radicals, forming transient organocuprate species. The latter paramagnetic compounds induce termination processes. Therefore, the mechanism of Cu-catalyzed termination will be studied in great detail to gain insight into the design of more selective catalysts and optimize polymerization conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000670.xml,Spectrum Innovates Pathway: Preparing Autistic Students to Enter Higher Education and Careers in Advanced Technological Fields,NSF,2020-08-15,2023-07-31,599836,"Based on recent estimates, about 1 in 60 children born in the United States are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.   Autism Speaks (autismspeaks.org) currently reports that as many as 90% of autistic individuals are unemployed or underemployed.  To address the autistic community's employment needs and the forecasted shortage of technicians in the aeronautics industry over the next twenty years, nfpNEXUS, Inc. will partner with Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology, Inc. to develop and implement the Spectrum Innovates Pathway project.  Design of this Pathway is informed by the findings of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2018) on best practices for learning, as well as recent research that has led to modified and new cognitive models for autism. The Spectrum Innovates Pathway will support autistic students who share a common passion for aeronautics. The primary goal of the Pathway is to prepare autistic students to succeed in higher education and to enter the workforce in advanced technician roles.  This project will provide full immersion of autistic students in a STEM learning environment designed to support them as they acquire the knowledge and certifications needed for their entry into advanced technical careers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop and implement a bridge year for autistic students who have completed their high school requirements. The project will leverage experiential learning to support students’ acclimation to the collegiate and work environments and development of critical life and practical skills. A robust recruitment process for students will increase awareness of the availability of the advanced technician options for autistic individuals. Students will be included in a cohort for the duration of the program, which is expected to contribute to creating a supportive learning environment. Student projects will model real world challenges to reinforce existing knowledge and skills. Industry partners will serve a dual role as advisors on emergent work force skills as well as identifying and promoting opportunities for autistic individuals in the job market. The Innovation Hub at Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology includes the Maker Space, Composite Prototyping Center, Robotics Lab, Flight Simulators, and Air Traffic Control Simulators.  This Hub will inform and drive the project and its methodology. Dissemination strategies will include postings about project activities and results on the project website and the Autism Speaks website, as well as through local workshops and presentations at conferences.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001248.xml,Diophantine Approximation and Aperiodic Order,NSF,2020-07-15,2024-06-30,186734,"This award aims to develop and harvest a collection of interrelated results spanning the fields of number theory, dynamical systems, and aperiodic order. A central theme is to explore problems which have known applications to the mathematics underpinning models for physical materials called quasicrystals. The research goals are to use tools from number theory, probability, topological dynamics, and ergodic theory, to prove new results about a number of long standing open problems with significance in the world of pure mathematics, which also have the potential for real world applications. The Principal Investigarot will mentor graduate students on topics related to this award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quasicrystals are physical materials with highly ordered molecular structures, causing them to produce pure point diffraction patterns, but which also possess rotational symmetries that are forbidden by the classical Crystallographic Restriction Theorem. The discovery of these materials in the 1980's by Dan Shechtman revolutionized the world of crystallography and later earned Shechtman a Nobel prize. In the mathematical world the study, and even the existence, of quasicrystals is intimately related to the theory of aperiodic tilings of Euclidean space. Quasicrystals are often modeled by cut and project sets, which give an abundance of examples of such tilings and which, generically, are good examples of systems which possess `aperiodic order'. In the last decade there has been an explosion of insight linking problems in number theory with problems about cut and project sets. A number of unsolved problems in Diophantine approximation have been reformulated, and some have been solved, using ideas from the theory of mathematical quasicrystals. Major problems about sets with aperiodic order have also been solved by understanding the reverse connections. The research in this project is centered around well-known open problems such as the Littlewood Conjecture and the Pisot Conjecture, which are sitting on the border of these subjects. It aims to develop the theory around them in order to create progress in both the realms of pure and applied mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000452.xml,Catalyst Project: Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting for Hydrogen and Oxygen Production Using Nanostructured Materials,NSF,2020-06-01,2024-05-31,149971,"Catalyst Projects provide support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities to work towards establishing research capacity of faculty to strengthen science, technology, engineering and mathematics undergraduate education and research. It is expected that the award will further the faculty member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution and involve undergraduate students in research experiences.  The award to the University of Arkansas Pine Bluff has potential to broaden impacts in several areas. The goal of this project is to study the use of light, electricity and novel materials to generate hydrogen and oxygen from water. The production of these gases proves to be useful for proposed space travel. Several undergraduate students will participate in this work and learn techniques and theories related to nanomaterial fabrication and energy production.  This project is jointly funded by HBCU-UP and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting using nanomaterials is one of the most promising techniques to generate hydrogen in an easier, cheaper and sustainable way. PEC water splitting is a process which involves generation of charge carriers (electrons and holes) by solar radiation and their transfer to respective electrodes to produce H2 and O2. However, charge separation and transportation are the major concerns in PEC water splitting. Here we propose to develop a novel and highly efficient PEC water splitting nanocatalyst, by carefully growing a PEC-efficient catalyst with a suitable band width nanomaterial on a three-dimensional nanographene scaffold via a convenient one-pot hydrothermal synthesis. This novel nanocatalyst can achieve high surface to volume ratio which therefore facilitates charge separation and suppress electron-hole pair recombination. In addition, the desired PEC catalyst’s band width can be realized by controlling its size and morphology. Optimum conditions for synthesizing the desired nanostructures will be established to maximize the water-splitting efficiency. Results will help solve the hydrogen and oxygen shortage during space missions and surface applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002476.xml,P2C2: Collaborative Research: Transient forcing of the Local Last Glacial Maximum in the tropical Peruvian Andes,NSF,2020-06-15,2025-05-31,165597,"The geological history of tropical glaciers can provide scientists an important perspective from the past on how Earth’s climate system responds to human activity. This project will look to the geological record of tropical glaciers in the Andes Mountains for a perspective on past changes in the glacial ice extent and how these changes may relate to records of changes in the atmospheric conditions during periods of abrupt climate change. These records of glacial activity will help place the current state of rapidly retreating ice margins in the tropics in a longer-term context that extends well beyond the instrumental record. Finally, by integrating multiple archives of past climates and modeling the causes of tropical high elevation climate changes, this work will improve our understanding of abrupt global climate changes because these regions had much larger glaciers in the past. By determining ages on the rocks that were transported by the ancient glaciers and combining analyses of lake sediments deposited continuously below the glaciers, this research will provide a detailed record of how much the glaciers changed and when. The research team will incorporate climate model simulations to test the causes of tropical climate changes and how they relate to high latitude warming and cooling events. This project will train 3 graduate students, and at least 4 undergraduate students. The project team will improve K-12 science education and engagement by exposing teachers and students (both local and abroad) to research through the GLOBE program (Global Learning and Observation to Benefit the Environment). The team also will partner with INAIGEM in Peru to broaden project impact, and help with the mission of educational capacity building.<br/> <br/>This project will evaluate tropical glacial variability during the local Last Glacial Maximum (LLGM) to better understand how low latitude temperature variability and the hydrologic cycle were modulated by ocean and atmospheric processes. This research has the following objectives: 1) determine robust ages of moraines using terrestrial cosmogenic radionuclide (TCN) dating methods to provide information about both the timing and extent of multiple LLGM ice limits; 2) rigorously evaluate centennial-scale records of glacial flour flux using high-resolution geochemical archives from the recently acquired Lake Junín drill-core record; 3) test the scale and climatic forcing of LLGM climate variability using climate model simulations; 4) test the scale of LLGM glacier variability responses to climatic forcing using energy and mass-balance models. This research will produce multi-proxy, centennial-scale records of mountain glaciation in Peru spanning the LLGM, at a scale and resolution that has not yet been achieved. This resolution will be sufficient to make comparisons with ice cores from Greenland, Antarctica, and the tropical Andes, as well as decadal-scale speleothem-based stable isotope records of hydroclimate changes from the same (Lake Junín) catchment. This will allow for a collective evaluation of mountain glacier archives and other regional records of past atmospheric variability that will improve our understanding of the role of the tropics in abrupt global change events on millennial timescales. These records will provide insight on the sensitivity of tropical glaciers to a range of climate conditions, both atmospheric and oceanic, and particularly how the tropical climate system responds to meltwater forcing. Ultimately, these records will inform how the tropical hydrologic cycle drives glacial-interglacial cycles in both the low and high latitudes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This series of biennial conferences has a 26-year history; it is organized under the American Institute of Mathematical Sciences (AIMS). The conference has focus in the growing field of analysis and applied analysis with emphasis on dynamical systems, differential equations, and applications. The conference will foster international collaborations between researchers in these fields. It features a large number of presentations by graduate students and female mathematicians and scientists.<br/><br/>While modern mathematics now encompasses a vast range of topics, dynamical systems and differential equations have retained their central role because of the wide variety of applications ranging from the traditional areas of physics and engineering to the more recently developed and growing applications in biology, chemistry, ecology, physiology, economics and finance.

2001868.xml,Doctoral Dissertation Research: Differentiating Effects of Particularistic Performance Standards in the Workplace,NSF,2020-06-01,2022-05-31,15521,"This research investigates how performance standards in the workplace create barriers to inclusion.  The specific focus is on how sound and voice criteria for broadcasters have constrained plans of inclusion in broadcasting organizations in different regions.  The project investigates 1) the creation of public radio broadcast standards, 2) the endurance of these standards despite demographic changes, and 3) how broadcasters experience these standards.

2002276.xml,Collaborative Research: Quantifying the sea-surface temperature pattern effect for Last Glacial Maximum and Pliocene constraints on climate sensitivity,NSF,2020-06-01,2025-05-31,431412,"Predictions of future climate change are based in part on changes seen in geological records of times with different climates. Such times include the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) 21 thousand years ago (a colder time with lower atmospheric carbon dioxide levels) and the Pliocene Epoch 5.3 to 2.6 million years ago (a warmer time with higher carbon dioxide). These periods can be used to estimate the sensitivity of climate to changes in greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. Those sensitivity estimates help predict the amount of global warming we should expect to see in response to future greenhouse gas emissions. However, recent work has shown that the climate’s sensitivity to greenhouse gases depends not only on the average surface temperature change but also on the geographic pattern of that change. Thus, use of geological paleoclimate records to estimate future warming must account for how the spatial pattern of temperature changes in the past differs from that expected in the future. This project will combine information from paleoclimate data and climate models to evaluate the spatial pattern of surface temperature changes during the LGM and Pliocene. It will then develop methods to account for temperature pattern differences when using data from these past periods to help estimate future global warming.<br/><br/>Earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is the change in average surface temperature associated with a doubling of the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (CO2) relative to the pre-industrial atmosphere. The ECS is set by the radiative feedbacks that link surface warming to changes in the amount of radiation leaving Earth’s atmosphere. Recent studies have shown that global radiative feedbacks depend on the spatial pattern of sea-surface temperature (SST). Estimates of ECS based on the proxy record of past climate changes – such as those during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and Pliocene –  have traditionally been based on global mean energy budget constraints and thus do not account for how SST patterns in those states may be different from those in the future. This research will use recently developed data assimilation techniques, combining information from climate models and proxies, to reconstruct gridded SST fields for the LGM and Pliocene that are dynamically consistent with available proxy data. These SST fields will then be compared against those projected by global climate models under CO2 forcing. The sensitivity of radiative feedbacks to differences between LGM / Pliocene and CO2-forced SST patterns will then be quantified using a suite of atmospheric general circulation models and Green’s functions that link warming patterns to radiative feedbacks. By producing estimates of LGM and Pliocene surface temperature patterns and quantifying the impact of temperature pattern differences on radiative feedbacks, this research will improve our understanding of ECS derived from those past climate states. This work will further facilitate researchers’ participation in activities aimed at introducing high school students to climate science, through Current Climate Science workshops for high school teachers facilitated by the University of Washington’s Program on Climate Change and through George Mason University’s Aspiring Scientists Summer Internship Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000037.xml,Modern Aspects of Multivariable Operator Theory and Matrix Analysis,NSF,2020-07-01,2024-09-30,249000,"Operator theory and matrix analysis are both fundamental areas of mathematics. In large part, they were originally developed to provide a theoretical basis for quantum mechanics and other physical phenomena. An increasing number of application areas have emerged as a result of breakthroughs in operator theory and matrix analysis, which testify to their underlying importance to science and engineering. The areas of application closest to the research in this project are control systems engineering, electrical engineering, signal processing, image processing, and quantum computation. The principal investigator will build on his past work to further develop the interplay between the subdisciplines of free function theory, operator completions, statistical signal processing, matrix inequalities, and optimization. To accomplish this goal the principal investigator will continue existing collaborations as well as develop new ones, and engage actively with both graduate students and undergraduate students in the emerging research. The principal investigator will continue to maintain an intellectual environment fostering student involvement and development, providing the students with the skills, experience, and confidence to successfully pursue a career in the mathematical sciences. Thus, the project will yield both new, impactful mathematical results, as well as highly trained mathematicians prepared to join the scientific and educational workforce crucial to this nation.<br/>   <br/>Many questions in system and control theory, filter design, signal and image processing come down to function theoretic questions. The case of several variables is a highly active research area where the techniques of multivariable operator theory are highly effective.

2001116.xml,Reasoning Language for Teaching Secondary Algebra,NSF,2019-09-01,2024-01-31,444474,"Decades of research have demonstrated that stronger mathematics classroom discourse, along with the use and connection of multiple mathematical representations, correlates positively with gains in student learning.  This relationship is particularly salient in algebra, where diversifying the representations available to students can provide important supports for the development of conceptual understanding. The Reasoning Language for Teaching Secondary Algebra (ReLaTe-SA) project proposes to study the teaching and learning of algebra in grades 7-9, with a specific focus on the ways in which classroom language explicitly describes properties of and relationships among algebraic objects. The project seeks to investigate the bi-directional relationship between reasoning-rich algebraic discourse and the mathematical meanings students hold for core algebraic concepts such as equations, the equation-solving process, and functions. With a focus on the teacher, ReLaTe-SA will analyze classroom narratives about algebraic concepts and procedures and provide an 80-hour professional development program designed to support teachers in developing stronger explanations of algebraic objects, their properties, and their relationships.<br/><br/>The ReLaTe-SA project will investigate three aspects of teacher discourse practice related to algebra. First, the project will study the discourse and discourse routines that teachers use to explain algebraic objects, their properties, and their relationships. This will be accomplished through the development and deployment of an assessment called the Survey of Algebraic Language and Reasoning to identify teachers' discursive routines and narratives in the context of algebra. The instrument asks teachers to interpret student work and explanations by describing the student's mathematical reasoning and underlying mathematical understandings. Second, the project will support potential growth in teachers' algebraic discourse practices through an 80-hour professional development intervention focused on discourse in algebra. The impact of this intervention will be measured by changes to teachers' response patterns on the Survey of Algebraic Language and Reasoning, analyses of teachers' work within the professional development, and the analysis of classroom observations after the professional development has concluded. Third, the project will seek to understand the ways in which teachers develop lessons that explicitly focus on the development of students' algebraic reasoning and discourse.

Specifically, this project will use high resolution trace element analyses (mainly magnesium, strontium and barium) and Oxygen stable isotopes from speleothem records located in the South African south coast to address the following questions: 1) How did changes in global boundary conditions at the last glacial-interglacial transition affect hydroclimate on the southern coast of South Africa? 2) How are changes in hydroclimate related to variations of atmospheric circulation and synoptic conditions during rainfall formation and rainfall seasonality? 3) How are these high-resolution proxy records related to millennial scale climate variations in the southern and northern hemisphere? Additionally, this project will identify sulfur peaks in the speleothems that are associated with the younger Toba eruption to link these records to ice core records from both hemispheres. <br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts include generating a new multi-proxy hydroclimate record in South Africa. This record will further the understanding of past climate variability in this region and provide a context for the evolution of plant diversity and modern human behaviors. The paleoclimate proxy records produced by this project will inform the development of a model that reconstructs the resource landscape that people have encountered in this region and thus inform the critical understanding of hunter-gatherer adaptations to their environments. Other Broader Impacts include strengthening multi-institution and international collaborations to develop a multi-proxy speleothem record, the training of undergraduate students, support for a post-doctoral researcher and an early career scientist.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002367.xml,Modular Transition Metal Chalcogenide Coordination Polymers,NSF,2020-09-01,2023-08-31,468491,"Non-Technical Summary<br/> <br/>Modern society is built on ever increasing technological advances. Recent decades have seen this advancement come from sophisticated processing and engineering perhaps best exemplified by miniaturization largely driven by the surge in nanoscience. Conversely, the discovery of fundamentally new materials has been more limited and many modern innovations rely on classic materials such as bulk silicon. A new class of materials, known as coordination polymers, represent an extremely attractive system for the rational design and tuning of new materials with tailored properties. While there have been dramatic advances in this area, there are still fundamental limitations in the composition of these materials that prevent their use in potentially transformative applications such as renewable energy, next generation electronics, and new magnetic materials. This fundamental research project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research, guides the discovery of a novel family of coordination polymers built upon sulfur-based nodes and linkers. Unlike most coordination polymers which rely upon oxygen- or nitrogen-based components, sulfur-based materials exhibit strong interactions between their individual building blocks which enhances their electronic and magnetic properties. Through advances in the fundamental synthetic techniques and an expansive compositional scope, these newly designed materials have the potential to enable new applications in revolutionary technology. In parallel with these research efforts, the principle investigator establishes a local conference in the Chicago area, particularly aimed at including undergraduate students, graduate students, and local postdoctoral researchers. This conference generates a community of researchers in the Chicago area as well as a link to ongoing efforts with younger students to increase scientific communication and literacy. <br/><br/>Technical Summary <br/><br/>The key fundamental challenge associated with the discovery of new chalcogenide-based coordination polymers is the generation of reliable synthetic protocols for families of novel materials. Such synthetic protocols are relatively well established for more classic coordination polymer materials with carboxylate linkers. Several early examples of chalcogenide-based coordination polymers exhibit remarkable properties and activity, but there is a dearth of these materials compared to their O- and N-based congeners which arises from more poorly understood synthetic protocols. Precise synthetic control over these materials is required to tune morphology, crystallinity, solubility, and electronic structure. This fundamental research project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research, establishes the much needed reliable synthetic control that is essential for understanding and tuning bulk properties such as conductivity or magnetism, where defects and grain sizes may have a determinative role on the observed behavior. The synthetic protocols and the resulting family of new materials enables the detailed study of physical properties and more clearly elucidates how the incorporation of chalcogenides mediates enhanced magnetic and electronic coupling. Furthermore, these efforts enable the inclusion of new components into coordination polymers: for example, the researchers study new chalcogenide-based linkers as well as new nodes such as polynuclear chalcogenide clusters. The combination of synthetic access to a variety of new materials and a detailed understanding of their properties enables rational tuning and control over their functionality.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main objective of this conference is to bring together a broad range of researchers in Analysis, Mathematical Physics, Probability on Fractals and other research areas for the purpose of scientific exchange, planning of new projects, and education and training of entering researchers. These conferences have been held every three years starting in 2002. The five-day meeting will be structured in three parts: half-hour talks in the mornings by leading researchers in the field to describe recent important advances; mini-courses in the early afternoons to enable advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and researchers from related fields to learn some of the foundations of the area and discuss important open problems, and 20-minute talks in parallel sessions in the late afternoons to allow all attendees to present their research. A large number of early-career researchers, including members of underrepresented groups and undergraduate students, from both the Cornell SPUR and University of Connecticut REU programs, are expected to benefit from these courses. A number of applied mathematicians and theoretical physicists attend these conferences, so the conference will help foster the growing interactions between the mathematics and physics communities with interests in these areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many ways in which fractals appear in current mathematical research. The topics of this conference are those where the underlying space is fractal, and the subjects studied include the analogs of differential equations, random processes and models of physical interactions taking place on these fractal spaces. Due to the pioneering work of Barlow, Perkins, Bass, Kusuoka, Zhou and Kigami there is a well-established, rigorous mathematical framework for discussing such problems. This conference is expected to expand to new directions of research, including new trends in potential, geometric and probabilistic analysis on non-smooth and fractal spaces.

Few studies have researched police behavior against  women across social class lines.  This project addresses three questions: (1) How does social class influence women’s experiences with police? (2) How prevalent is police misbehavior involving women? (3) How do women draw on resources to contend with police misbehavior involving themselves and their communities? This study will provide empirical evidence regarding the impact of social class on police misbehavior involving women, including the documentation of various forms of misbehavior. Findings from this project will assist stakeholders at multiple levels of government in creating gender-inclusive police procedural and police reform policies. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project uses a mixed-methodological design consisting of interviews, field observations, and surveys. In-depth interviews are conducted with women from different social class backgrounds about their interactions with police. Field observations include attendance at community events regarding women, police misbehavior, or police reform. Local surveys are utilized to examine the specific types of policing women report experiencing. Based on an analysis of these data, a national survey was developed to examine the prevalence and scope of police misbehavior involving women. Findings from the national survey will provide insights regarding criminological theories of policing, as well as theories regarding racial inequality and gender inequality in the operation of the criminal justice system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002546.xml,Orbital to millennial-scale variability of the Southern Hemisphere Westerlies over the last glacial cycle,NSF,2020-09-01,2025-08-31,402158,"The Southern Hemisphere westerly winds are a crucial component of the global climate system, playing an important role in controlling the weather of the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes through the seasonal transmission of precipitation-generating storm systems, as well as through their influence on the circulation of the Southern Ocean. It has been hypothesized that past changes in the position and strength of the westerlies may have also impacted the global carbon cycle through their influence on storage of carbon dioxide in the deep ocean, with impacts on global climate.  Models also suggest that future warming will also result in changes in the westerlies, with the potential to drive changes in the storage or release of carbon dioxide from the Southern Ocean. However, the westerlies respond to a number of factors including regional, hemispheric and global patterns of warming, ocean circulation and Southern Ocean sea ice cover.  In order to better understand how these factors influence the westerlies and their potential role in changing in the carbon cycle, this research project will generate a new reconstruction of the westerly wind response to a range of natural climate factors over the past ~140,000 years. In combination with the results of climate model simulations, the results of this study will provide a better understanding of how and why the westerlies change, and will thus provide a perspective from the geological past on how the westerlies will respond to future changes in global climate. The impacts of this research on society will be presented to the public through venues such the University of Texas Geoforce program, local community organizations, ongoing activities and outreach at local K-12 schools, through programs such as Girls Start and the Boy Scouts. <br/><br/>This research will focus on the generation of a new high-resolution record of past westerly wind behavior using the laminated sediment record from Lake Orakei, a volcanic crater lake located on the North Island of New Zealand.  Reconstructions will use the hydrogen isotope composition of sedimentary leaf waxes as a proxy for the position of the westerlies, an approach that is grounded in a study of modern isotope dynamics in this region. The reconstructions will be complemented by temperature reconstructions based on the MBT’5ME paleotemperature proxy and will focus on understanding the timing and nature of the westerly response to orbital forcing, the growth and retreat of the ice sheets and, over targeted intervals, the response to millennial-scale variability during Dansgaard-Oeschger and Heinrich stadials.  A robust proxy-model comparison approach will be used to better understand the underlying climate dynamics driving the westerly wind response to these forcing mechanisms.

2002701.xml,"Charge distribution within supported metal nanoclusters and how it is influenced by the substrate, adsorption and surface defects",NSF,2020-09-01,2024-08-31,480000,"Professor Jory A. Yarmoff of the University of California - Riverside is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to study the charge distribution within supported metal nanoclusters.  Professor Yarmoff and his students use specialized characterization methods to investigate how the properties of metal nanoparticles are affected by the nature of the support material on which they reside and how defects in the support alter their properties. In particular, they measure the charge on individual atoms within the clusters and observe how the cluster size and number of support defects affect what molecules will or will not stick to the supports.  Nanoparticles are a distinctive class of materials because they have sizes intermediate between molecules (few atoms) and solids (trillions of atoms).  Nanoscale materials exhibit unique chemical and electronic properties that depend on their size, leading to many potential applications that include advanced electronics, battery technologies, solar power generation, environmental remediation, and chemical catalysis.  Understanding, and then learning how to control the properties of nanoscale materials broadly, impacts knowledge in basic science and practical applications.  A diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students at the University of California-Riverside, an Hispanic serving institution, are gaining valuable experience by conducting laboratory experiments in a field at the forefront of modern science. In addition, the research results are disseminated via multifaceted in-house and outreach initiatives.  This includes participation in a Summer Physics Teachers Academy, a week-long workshop which includes hands-on laboratory experiences to train local high school teachers and stimulate the interest of their students in STEM careers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The edge atoms of supported metal nanoclusters may be the active sites that drive chemical reactions via adsorption of precursor molecules to the cluster atoms that are directly bonded to the substrate. There is also strong evidence that the electronic environment of metal nanoclusters is critical in determining their electronic and chemical behaviors. Supported metal nanoclusters are directly deposited, or produced by buffer layer assisted growth (BLAG), onto oxide, sulfide, fluoride and frozen noble gas substrates. A novel form of low energy ion scattering (LEIS) is used to investigate the charge distribution within metal nanoclusters by measuring the neutralization of scattered low energy alkali ions. This method previously showed that the charge within a gold nanocluster is inhomogeneous, with the edge atoms being positively charged while the center atoms are essentially neutral. This project builds on this knowledge by exploring how the charge distribution depends on the cluster and substrate materials, the number of defects at the cluster/support interface, the subsequent adsorption of electronegative and electropositive adatoms and small molecules, and how defects in the substrate modify adsorption. The research results wicontribute to a fundamental understanding of metal nanoclusters, thereby enabling the tailoring of their properties to improve functionality and practical utility. The research may have a significant and broad impact on the field by providing an understanding of the physical and chemical properties of nanoscale materials while developing methods to control them, which will facilitate their use in numerous advanced manufacturing applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To remain competitive, U.S. industries need to rapidly accelerate the use of intelligent robotics.  As a result, the nation needs to train highly skilled technicians who can program, use, maintain, and repair intelligent industrial robots. This collaborative project will address the nation’s shortfall of qualified technicians in intelligent industrial robotics.  It intends to do so by establishing a collaboration between academic institutions and major manufacturers in the eastern and central regions of Tennessee and Alabama. Together these partners will define the necessary skillset for the next-generation industrial robotics technical workforce.  They will also develop a curriculum that will allow students to learn those skills. This project will result in one of the first programs in the nation for workforce training in intelligent robotics and artificial intelligence technologies.  This effort will thus support U.S. businesses and industries to rapidly and effectively incorporate next-generation robotics in their workplace.<br/><br/>The project has the following specific aims:  1) develop intelligent robotics curricular modules; 2) implement train-the-trainer workshops for educators; 3) identify skill sets needed for handling the next-generation robotics; 4) develop a knowledge base of next-generation robotics for secondary and post-secondary educators; and 5) increase public awareness of next-generation robotics.

This project is important because signal processing is everywhere (cell phones, computer networks, manufacturing systems, agriculture, etc.). Adapting to the environment helps these systems to operate more reliably by, for example, adapting to changing radio interference or the challenging radio environments presented by clusters of tall buildings. Many of these communication systems are also battery-operated or must run on limited energy; adapting to their operating environments helps to reduce their energy consumption and improve battery life. These techniques are particularly useful for cognitive radio, an emerging technology that allows devices for wireless communication (such as cell phones) to more efficiently use radio spectrum. <br/><br/>This project will develop new methods for creating software that can be reconfigured at run time. Typical software is created to operate in a particular mode; changing the software?s operating conditions requires redesigning the software itself. New mathematical models and algorithms will allow system designers to create software that is designed to adapt itself dynamically to its environment. The project will address both models specifying the behavior of the software and for translating that specification into an efficient implementation. <br/><br/>The principal investigators will collaborate with colleagues at the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées (INSA) in Rennes, France, and National Chiao Tung University in Hsinchu, Taiwan. The collaborators in France and Taiwan will provide expertise in cognitive radio algorithms and hardware that complements the principal investigators? expertise in software design.

Biodiversity hotspots occupy only 2.3% of the earth’s land surface but harbor a high proportion of endemic species and house most undescribed plant diversity. An important biotic component of biodiversity hotspots include plants with unusual morphologies, such as succulence, carnivory, and epiphytism. These plants are highly adapted to live in extreme environments but face serious threats of extinction due to changing climate and land use regimes. This project partners the Herbarium at Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden (RSA) with the Endless Forms Project, a Thematic Collections Network (TCN) involving 17 institutions aimed at digitizing nearly 2 million herbarium specimens from 15 plant families with unusual adaptations. Collections targeted for this project are emblematic of the unique strengths of RSA and will add immeasurably to the Endless Forms TCN. This partnership fills an important gap by adding 70,100 herbarium specimens representing all families, some of which are especially diverse (cacti, agave, spurge) in California, a world biodiversity hotspot. Digitization will promote scientific investigation and public understanding of these potentially imperiled plants, and through public databases, will provide access to a rich source of specimen data. Graduate and undergraduate students will make up 90% of the workforce and participate in all aspects of the project. This project will enhance RSA’s existing internship program through increased participation of students from Hispanic Serving Institutions in the Greater Los Angeles metropolitan area.

This means that the order in which one performs measurements on certain physical systems matters.  In this context, we say that measurement is ""non-commutative"".  The inherent non-commutativity of quantum mechanics is described by the theory of operator algebras, which is the branch of mathematics that investigates how to efficiently manipulate and encode arbitrarily large matrices of numerical data.  Today,  operator algebras and quantum theory are both well-established and independent branches of the mathematical sciences. However, in recent years, with the advent of quantum computation and quantum information science, there has been a resurgence of fruitful interactions between the more mathematical theory of operator algebras and the more physical theory of quantum mechanics.  The primary goal of this project is to explore and deepen the emerging connections between operator algebra theory and quantum information theory (QIT).  The central objects of study in this project are quantized symmetries in operator algebras and QIT.  Understanding the symmetries of systems has long been a powerful tool in mathematical and physical problems, and the highly non-commutative nature of both operator algebras and QIT naturally leads to the discovery of more flexible notions of symmetries, called quantum symmetries.  In this project, we will use various mathematical incarnations of quantum symmetries to provide a link between operator algebra theory and QIT, and we will use this link to provide new insights into both of these important fields. This project will contribute to the development of the US workforce through the training of graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This research project breaks up into two main directions. The first direction concerns the structural theory of some new and interesting classes of operator algebras arising from quantum isomorphism spaces.  Quantum isomorphism spaces appear naturally in the study of quantum teleportation and super-dense coding schemes in QIT, and also in the representation theory of quantum permutation groups.  The study of these algebras leads us to propose a quantum analogue of Lueck’s determinant conjecture from geometric group theory and investigate its potential applications to constructing new examples of strongly 1-bounded and strongly solid von Neumann algebras. The second direction of this project relates to the Principal Investigator's pioneering work on the interactions between quantum symmetries and QIT. Here, geometric and representation-theoretic tools will be used to find applications of non-local games arising in QIT to the construction of new examples of hyperlinear discrete quantum groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001439.xml,"RUI: Compactifying Moduli Spaces of Orbits, Covers, and Curves",NSF,2020-09-01,2024-08-31,160217,"One of the most consequential advances in mathematics during the 20th century was motivated by a change in perspective: instead of studying a single mathematical object, we should broaden our scope and study how classes of objects fit together in families. To draw an analogy with ecology, this change in perspective is akin to the realization that, in order to understand the movement of a single fish in the sea, it helps a great deal to understand how that fish interacts with the other members of their school. In mathematics, the notion of a moduli space loosely refers to an entire family of objects; for example, in the fish analogy, the moduli space could refer to the entire school of fish. Moduli spaces can, themselves, be treated as a single entity, comprised of many, and we can learn about the objects we are interested in by studying the shape of the moduli space that parametrizes them. It can be especially enlightening to understand the shape of moduli spaces near their boundary, and the research supported by this NSF award is driven by the goal of understanding the shape of the boundary of a number of moduli spaces that parametrize different types of families of algebraic curves. This project provides research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research aspects in this project fall into three interrelated categories, all with the common theme of investigating various compact moduli spaces of curves and what geometric and enumerative information can be gleaned from the structure of their boundary. In the first line of problems, the PI will study new classes of moduli spaces that can be realized as wonderful compactifications associated to certain complex reflection groups. These new moduli spaces provide a fertile testing ground for investigating the extent to which polyhedral methods can be generalized beyond toric varieties. In the second line of problems, the PI will introduce moduli spaces into the study of factorization problems in complex reflection groups. In particular, the primary objective is to study the polynomial structure of factorizations by constructing a suitable compactification of the associated moduli spaces of admissible covers. In the final line of problems, the PI will initiate a study of the tautological rings of the moduli spaces of pseudo-stable curves. These spaces provide alternative compactifications of the moduli spaces of curves that allow for curves with cuspidal singularities, instead of the usual nodal singularities, and progress in this research would lead to advances concerning the enumerative geometry of curves with cuspidal singularities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To ensure the security of computers and information systems, all sectors need well-prepared technicians who can prevent, detect, and investigate cybersecurity breaches. Toward meeting this need, the project will launch a project designed to align K-12 curricula with industry needs and to foster proficiency in cybersecurity for students in the Pittsburgh area. Through this project, the College aims to: (1) increase the number of students, especially students from underrepresented groups, in its cybersecurity-focused associate degree program in information technology; (2) improve instruction to better prepare students for the local cybersecurity workforce; and (3) introduce educational activities into secondary schools to prepare students for further education in cybersecurity. <br/><br/>The investigators will develop an innovative model for partnerships with high schools by collaborating with the Beaver County Career and Technology Center, which works with more than 17 high schools in the Pittsburgh area to prepare students in technical areas, including cybersecurity. To broaden participation in cybersecurity, the project team will target middle school and Career Tech Center students from underserved communities for participation in summer camps, cybersecurity competitions, conferences, and mentoring. To expand and strengthen cybersecurity instruction, the project team will engage teachers in applied active-learning-and-teaching methods using virtual lab environments and will offer workshops on curriculum development and topics in cybersecurity. To align the college's cybersecurity curriculum with needs of business and industry, the project team will enhance the advisory board's role in shaping the curriculum, providing presentations about the field, mentoring students, and designing internships and other pathways to jobs. The project will add instruction that helps students research the requirements for specific cybersecurity jobs and connect those requirements with the knowledge and skills they are developing in their coursework. The project evaluation will examine the effectiveness of virtual environments in training job-ready cybersecurity students, the effectiveness of industry-led approaches for encouraging high school students to apply to two-year cybersecurity programs, and the effectiveness of practices to engage business/industry partners in designing and developing curricula and recruiting students from underrepresented groups.

In order to extract useful information and fully achieve the potential of IoT for intelligent decisions, it is critical to develop novel systems to efficiently transmit, store and process this large volume of data. Fortunately, the data generated by IoT and many other applications typically possesses certain low dimensional parsimonious structures. Leveraging on these low dimensional structures of IoT data, this project will develop methods based on low dimensional sketches to infer information of interest. This sketching based framework will enable quick and accurate information extraction with greatly reduced sampling rates, transmission and storage costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a sketching based framework for the efficient processing of high dimensional data generated by IoT and investigate its theoretical and algorithmic properties. The core idea is to take low dimensional projections or sketches of random variables, rather than to directly and fully observe high dimensional random variables. This project will develop both non-adaptive and adaptive low dimensional sketching methods, and will make the following intellectual contributions: 1) deriving fundamental limits on sampling rates for recovering statistical information of high dimensional random variables; 2) designing explicit sampling schemes that achieve the corresponding fundamental limits on sampling rates; 3) providing fast algorithms with performance guarantees for recovering statistical information from sketches of random variables. The PIs will leverage their research experience in compressed sensing, low-rank matrix recovery and sequential analysis in solving these challenging problems. The generated results are expected to extend compressed sensing from sketching of deterministic values to a broader context of sketching of random variables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the broader temporal and spatial patterns, timing, and amplitude of cool and warm periods across eastern North America may aid in constraining model scenarios of future temperature change.<br/><br/>Longer temperature records (e.g. that extend beyond the instrumental period) may provide information on: (i) past and current spatiotemporal characteristics of temperature variability; (ii) the full range and amplitude of pre-instrumental temperatures; (iii) the timing and direction of temperature rate changes; and (iv) the influence of ocean and atmosphere forcing mechanisms on centennial-scale temperature variability and the sensitivity of temperature changes to these climatic forcing mechanisms.<br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts include developing data from a data poor geographic location that are well situated to advance knowledge on North American climate, supporting graduate students from underrepresented groups, and providing outreach to K-12 STEM audiences including those involving Native American communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001622.xml,Arithmetic structure and distribution,NSF,2020-07-01,2021-06-30,95398,"Many questions in arithmetic can be phrased in terms of the superposition of waves by way of the Fourier Transform. A basic question is ""What do the frequencies of these waves tell us about their interference and vice versa?"". The interference of the waves has to do with the magnitude of their superposition, and the concentration of the interference can be made large by choosing the frequencies according to a strict pattern. One of the questions pursued by the PI is the converse: are these patterns necessary to achieve a very concentrated superposition. This is called the Inverse Littlewood Problem. The second question under investigation is an uncertainty principle. Suppose we have two families of waves that can be used to decompose a signal, and these two families are very incompatible. This incompatibility means we expect that a simple wave from one family looks much more complicated as a superposition from the second. A specific instance of this is whether a multiplicative character (a very simple wave in one family) can be decomposed as an additive convolution (a fairly simple superposition in another family). This is called Sarkozy's Problem.<br/><br/>There is a long history of comparing the distribution and arithmetic structure of sequences in number theory. Classically, the connection is observed by way of the Fourier transform. Towards a better understanding of this phenomenon, the PI plans to build upon recent results that relate the dimension of a finite subset of a lattice to estimates on the L^1-norm of its associated Fourier series. This area of investigation began with a conjecture of Littlewood on how small the L^1 -norm of the Fourier transform of a finite set of integers could be. The problem was resolved independently by Konyagin and McGehee-Pigno-Smith in the 1980s. Recently, questions have turned to classifying the extremizers in this problem, and the PI has recently proved that they must be, in an appropriate sense, low-dimensional. In this project he will develop the method further, by weakening hypotheses and applying these results to problems in arithmetic reliant the L^1 norm. In the finite field setting, the PI and Petridis have made substantial progress on a problem of Sarkozy concerning sumsets and the quadratic residues. They have resolved the conjecture for almost all primes. The PI will develop the ideas further so as to resolve the conjecture in earnest. Beyond this, he will adapt the method to other problems, which in turn will lead to progress on Vinogradov’s conjecture on the least non-residue.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A common situation for analysts is needing to manage multiple views of a dataset at the same time, raising questions of how visual analysis tools can help analysts see relationships between separate views. Current tools require extensive effort, such as repetitively selecting individual nodes in a graph and manually following information highlighted in a histogram, scatterplot, and map to identify abnormal behaviors. This project will investigate methods for analytics tools to flexibly and unobtrusively display relationships across multiple visualizations for supporting data analytics. Doing this will deepen our scientific understanding of how multiple visualizations support sensemaking of data and expand the design space of multi-view visualizations. The work will also enrich educational materials in data science and human-centered computing courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes four major lines of work. First, the team will design a usable overview of cross-view data relationships, supported by computations, for helping users to relate information from multiple visualizations. This design highlights a core concept of ""context separation"", which creates stand-alone views to plot computed, cross-view data relationships instead of relying on displayed visual elements. Second, the researchers will create a novel layout method for spatially organizing multiple visualizations by considering data relationships among them. Third, the team will develop novel user interactions for manipulating displayed cross-view data relationships, including merging and splitting, to support both analysis and navigation. Fourth, the team will conduct user experiments to study the effectiveness and cognitive load of these cross-view data relationship visualizations.

At the same time, the rapid growth of high-speed wireless network services presents an opportunity for future distributed learning involving a vast number of smart IoT devices. This project targets several technical challenges posed by the limited reliability of wireless connections and computational constraints of the edge nodes in distributed learning systems. Overcoming these challenges is vital to the plethora of computation, communication, and coordination tasks required by distributed machine learning at the network edge. Centered on developing innovative edge learning algorithms over wireless MAC channels under the constraints of computing, power, and bandwidth, this project can significantly impact wireless edge learning in a variety of IoT applications, ranging from transportation, safety, and agriculture, to energy efficiency, e-health, and smart infrastructure. The broader impact of this research will also come through many educational opportunities by providing opportunities in STEM to K-12, women, and underrepresented minority students.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project will develop an innovative network architecture for distributed learning over wireless multi-access channels. Specifically, the PIs will take a principled approach to develop an integrated wireless edge learning framework, using both gradient-based methods and also very recent advances in gradient-free, zero-order optimization, while taking into account the constraints in computing, power and bandwidth therein, in a holistic manner. The developed methods will be also extended to the setting of distributed online learning and reinforcement learning under wireless MAC. The PIs will focus on optimizing communication-efficient gradient sparsification based local updates that are communicated within the wireless network under bandwidth constraints; and each sender intelligently carries out transmission power allocation based on learning gradient and channel conditions. One important objective is to develop a novel learning-based framework for efficient wireless channel estimation and update to enable effective power control and learning.

2000424.xml,Collaborative Research: Paving the Way for Fractions: Identifying Foundational Concepts in First Grade,NSF,2020-06-01,2025-05-31,231389,"Although fractions represent a crucial topic in early childhood education, many students develop only a tenuous grasp of fraction concepts, even after several years of fraction instruction that is aligned with current standards. The goal of this project, led by a team of researchers at the University of Delaware and Temple University, is to answer important questions about the informal understandings of fractions young children have before they come to school and what their relations are to fraction learning in more formal instructional settings. Proficiency with fractions dramatically increases the likelihood of students succeeding in math, which in turn increases participation in the STEM workforce. Importantly, large individual differences in fraction understandings are apparent at the start of fractions instruction in the intermediate grades. Early fraction misunderstandings cascade into more severe math weaknesses in later grades, especially when instruction may shift abruptly from whole numbers to fractions. There is a critical need to understand the roots of individual differences that arise before formal instruction takes place. Young children possess important informal fraction understandings before they come to school, but the range of these abilities and their role in formal fraction learning and development is not well understood. The goal of this project is: a) to investigate the extent to which individual differences in informal fraction-related knowledge in first-grade children are associated with short- and longer-term fractions and math outcomes; and b) to see whether there is a causal link between level of informal fraction-related knowledge and the ability to profit from fractions instruction that directly builds on this knowledge. The findings from the project hold promise for informing early childhood educators how fractions can be incorporated in the first-grade curriculum in new and meaningful ways. Though the findings should be beneficial to all students, the project will specifically target members of groups underrepresented in STEM fields, including ethnic and racial minority and low-income students. The project is jointly funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning, and by the Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12), which supports the research and development of innovative resources, models and tools in order to enhance STEM learning and teaching by pre-K-12 students and teachers. <br/><br/>The project design includes both an observational study and an experimental study. The observational study will: (1) document individual differences in informal fraction-related knowledge in first grade; (2) determine concurrent relations between this informal knowledge and general cognitive and whole number competencies; and (3) examine whether informal fraction-related knowledge at the beginning of first grade uniquely predicts math outcomes at the end. The experimental study will explore the extent to which first graders’ informal and formal fraction concepts can be affected by training. The researchers will test whether training on the number line, which is continuous and closely aligned with the mental representation of the magnitude of all real numbers, will help students capitalize on their informal fraction understandings of proportionality, scaling, and equal sharing as well as their experience with integers to learn key fraction concepts. Together, the synergistic studies will pinpoint the role informal fraction knowledge in learning key fraction concepts. All data will be collected in Delaware schools serving socioeconomically and ethnically diverse populations of students. Primary measures include assessments of informal fraction knowledge (proportional reasoning, spatial scaling, equal sharing), executive functioning, vocabulary, whole number knowledge, whole number/fraction number line estimation, formal fraction knowledge, and broad mathematics achievement (calculation, fluency, applied problems).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

GPU-accelerated multi-display applications for visualizing large 3D datasets are important because new scientific discoveries and dynamic investigations of complex digital contents rely on visualization results, favoring with latencies measured in milliseconds rather than seconds and the rich information displayed with high-resolution on multiple screens. The potential of this work is an end-to-end solution for visualizing large 3D datasets on a commodity desktop and providing high-speed interactions and visual explorations of the datasets while having the advantage on cost savings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even more specifically, the algorithms and visualization systems developed through this research will allow engineers and designers to interactively create, change, and visually analyze large datasets. By providing a parallel computational foundation on visualization further innovation in CAD research is possible. Graduate students involved will be trained in the principles and uses of advanced computer by designing and implementing GPU algorithms. In addition, creating applications that make good use of GPUs also impacts interactive learning, especially on graphics-assisted and multi-dimensional educational applications, by providing breakthrough technology to increase the performance of educational applications while displaying complex graphical contents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditionally, acceleration algorithms for rendering (e.g., view-dependent mesh simplification) are implemented sequentially in visualization applications, which are not suitable for fast processing the model, composed of large amount of geometric primitives. The algorithms developed in this project will support primitive-level parallelization on GPUs and enable dynamic adjustments of detail levels of 3D meshes upon the changes of camera configurations. Though multi-GPU applications are available commercially, load-balancing issues among GPUs have not been successfully addressed. Imbalanced workload distributions hurt overall performance and affect the quality of mesh renderings. This research will develop a screen-partitioning balancer to balance GPU workloads and employ a pipelined approach to conduct GPU-to-GPU and CPU-to-GPU streaming for efficient data management.

Light is an especially promising tool for triggering this on-demand carrier disintegration: it can pass through many barriers, be directed to precise locations, and be switched on and off easily. Most current biologically relevant technologies use high energy ultraviolet (UV) and visible light that do not penetrate tissue significantly. The research groups of Professor Samuel Thomas at Tufts University and Professor Vincent Rotello at the University of Massachusetts Amherst are working to overcome this limitation in therapeutic delivery by designing, developing, and understanding the ability of nano-sized materials to disintegrate upon exposure to low energy near-infrared (NIR) light. NIR light penetrates tissue to far greater depths than UV or visible light, providing access to new biological applications. They will gain understanding into how chemical design influences nanomaterial response to NIR light, and these materials will be further elaborated to target and deliver therapeutics to both cancer cells and bacterial biofilms. This research has the potential to benefit society through creation of new nanomaterials that harness NIR light to selectively deliver drugs and mitigate harmful side effects. Beyond the hands-on interdisciplinary training that this research provides to more graduate students, this project also provides targeted support for disadvantaged high school students to undertake research through the Tufts Summer Research Experience, thereby broadening participation in the STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>With support from the Biomaterials Program of the NSF Division of Materials Research, the goal of this research is to establish the ability of micelles in vitro to be degraded by singlet oxygen prepared in situ using NIR light.

The first phase of this project will be to prepare and characterize polymers and micelles with a range of singlet oxygen-cleavable linkers, reactivities, and polymer topologies. The second phase of this project will be to understand how chemical structure and nanomaterial composition determines loading of cargo, stability in serum, photodegradation, and triggered release. The third stage of this project will evaluate the in vitro cytotoxicity and anti-bacterial activity of cargo-loaded NIR-degradable micelles. Further extension of this understanding of fundamental structure-property relationships will include micelles with targeting groups on their surfaces such as the RGD motif for cancer cells and quaternary ammonium cations for bacterial biofilms.

Understanding the reliability of self-driving cars is a crucial step to ensuring that the impending ubiquity of self-driving cars causes as few fatalities as possible. Components like actuators, sensors, and computational elements that make up such systems have inherent vulnerabilities to faults due to manufacturing defects, aging, cyberattacks, and environmental factors. Repair and replacement of such components may reduce the risk of fault occurrences, but may be infeasible in terms of cost, safety, and availability. Alternately, certain faults and their false positives may trigger unnecessary repair or cause unnecessary reactions by the vehicle. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly and accurately identify faults in real time. This research will facilitate the development of in-the-field error mitigation techniques, resulting in more reliable autonomous cars. Furthermore, this research will support the technical development and engagement of an underrepresented cohort of graduate and undergraduate students at North Carolina A&T State University and North Carolina Central University through curriculum enhancements and participation in extracurricular activities such as the AutoDrive Challenge, a national self-driving car competition.<br/><br/>The proposed work will provide real-time diagnosis of transient, intermittent, and permanent faults that occur in a self-driving car. This analysis will substantially improve the performance and accuracy of fault classification/identification in complex systems. Multi-perspective error detection techniques, including discrete-event system analysis, data-driven analysis, and chip-level analysis, will be combined to diagnose faults in automotive systems. The discrete-event system analysis will detect and isolate a system's fault occurrences from external observation of general behaviors of the system and in the absence of full observation of occurred events. The data-driven analysis will use a novel fuzzy type-2 clustering-based method to detect whether a fault degraded performance. The chip-level analysis will detect when a computational component is malfunctioning based on equivalence checking of logic signals and state traces. The combination of these approaches will facilitate fault diagnosis of automotive systems in real-time and with greater accuracy and speed. The multi-perspective analysis will improve the understanding of how each perspective interacts with the other and has the potential to identify new fault types and patterns. The enhanced awareness created by integrating these three unique methods will facilitate automotive system fault diagnosis in real time with greater accuracy and speed than could be achieved by any of the methods individually.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Policy makers and others generally assume that if you provide the appropriate numbers, people will understand and use them. Previous research, however, has shown that individuals differ in how well they understand and use numbers and how much they rely on different sources of information in decision making. Individuals lower vs. higher in objective numeracy (numeric literacy) comprehend less and generally make poorer decisions when numbers are involved. This research has largely ignored two other numeric competencies: subjective numeracy and approximate number sense. In this project, the Principal Investigator will test how each of the three numeric competencies is related to decision processes and whether enhancing two of the competencies (objective numeracy and subjective numeracy) can subsequently improve judgments and choices.  This research will lead to better interventions to improve decision making about health and wealth.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In eleven studies, the Principal Investigator will test correlational and/or causal impacts of the numeric competencies on ten decision processes identified as important to judgments and choices.

2001219.xml,NSF-BSF Application: Selective Electrosorption for Boron Removal and Recovery from Seawater,NSF,2020-07-15,2024-06-30,391988,"Agricultural irrigation is the largest user of water in the United States, accounting for approximately 80 percent of the Nation’s clean water consumption. Seawater desalination is a drought-proof technology that can address growing demands for water in agriculture and other uses. At present, seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) is the best available commercially available desalination technology. However, the desalinated seawater cannot be used directly in irrigation due to the limited ability to remove boron. This results from limitations on the boron retention capability of commercial SWRO membranes. Boron adversely impacts plant growth and damages apple, citrus, grapes, and other crops when water containing more than 0.3 mg/L of boron is used in irrigation. Thus, commercial SWRO plants must use an additional purification step to reduce boron concentration to acceptable concentrations. This greatly increases the energy consumption and costs of using desalinated water for agriculture. The proposed research will address the inefficiencies associated with boron removal through the development of a novel selective separation technology based on electrosorption. This new technology will be chemical-free, energy efficient, and capable of recovering a high purity boron stream for beneficial uses. Successful completion of this project will advance the development of the next generation of sustainable SWRO plants, with great potential benefit to society. The project will fruther benefit society by providing research training to graduate and undergraduate students at Yale University. Also, the investigator will promote diversity and enhance the involvement of under-represented groups in science and engineering through engagement in Yale's K-12 outreach activities. <br/><br/>A critical and unresolved challenge in SWRO desalination is to produce a permeate water stream suitable for irrigation without additional and costly purification to remove plant-toxic elements such as boron. The overall goal of this project is to develop an innovative flow-through electrosorption process for boron removal and recovery in seawater desalination. To achieve this goal, the PI proposes to carry out an integrated experimental and modeling project structured around the following tasks: 1) fabrication of an ultra-selective positive electrode (anode) using boron-chelating resins as building blocks; 2) performance testing of the fabricated electrodes for selective boron removal and recovery; 3) elucidation of the mechanisms underlying selective boron electrosorption; 4) assessment of the impact of electrochemical reactions on the long-term stability and boron selectivity of the electrodes; and 5) evaluation and modeling of the energy consumption and boron selectivity of the combined SWRO-electrosorption process. The proposed work would be the first to study boron-selective removal and recovery from seawater using a chemical-free method. The successful completion of this research has potential to transform desalination through the development of a more energy efficient and sustainable boron removal and recovery process from SWRO plants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2001600.xml,Digitization TCN: Collaborative Research: Mobilizing Millions of Marine Mollusks of the Eastern Seaboard,NSF,2020-09-15,2024-08-31,39600,"The Eastern Seaboard of the United States (ESB, U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone) stretches from the Canadian border on the Atlantic along nearly 6,000 km of eastern coastline, around the Floridian Peninsula, and along the Gulf of Mexico to the south end of the Texan coast, including 18 U.S. states. The ESB region is densely populated, with 47% of the U.S. population expected to inhabit the counties adjacent to the shoreline by 2021. Habitat loss, pollution, overfishing, and climate change threaten commercially and ecologically important marine species all along the ESB. This project will make occurrence data with map coordinates available for over 3,000 species of mollusks that find their habitat along the ESB, including mussels, clams, conchs, snails, and squid. Data from these ecologically and commercially important species (over 4.5 million individual specimens) will be made available through public online data portals. While the geographic ranges for many species of mollusks are well-known, the extent of their distribution within the seafloor habitats they occupy is unknown. Adding map coordinates to occurrence records for live-collected mollusks in natural history collections will provide detailed knowledge of distributions. Because natural history collections have specimens collected from the mid-1800s to present, these occurrence records can help track distributional changes over time and lead to better fisheries and conservation management.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One hundred million mollusk specimens have been documented in natural history collections across North America, and the breadth, depth, and growth of these collections is exceptionally well-known compared to other invertebrate taxa. Mollusks are among the best sampled group of animals, with some species having over 2,000 digital records available in natural history collections making them extremely well-suited for environmental and biogeographical studies that track faunal change over time and space. However, already-digitized mollusk lots are missing essential data such as collecting date (30% of records) and reliable georeferences (85% of records). This project will generate reliable geo-coordinate data for all covered specimen lots using a collaborative georeferencing project in GeoLocate.  GeoLocate will add layers for bathymetric data, benthic habitat, and marine conservation areas. Incorporating bathymetry into GeoLocate to determine the extent of locations will also provide that capability for complex elevational data for terrestrial species. Important trait data will also be incorporated. For the first time, molluscan occurrence data will distinguish between live- and dead-collected specimens, with a defined vocabulary for traits added to each record. Due to the long persistence of molluscan shells, the live/dead- collected distinction is crucial for all studies of biotic change using mollusks. Information on collecting dates will be refined where possible to increase resolution for detecting biotic changes. The data will be shared through public data repositories, including iDigBio, GBIF, OBIS, and the InvertEBase Symbiota portal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Significant advances have been made on these neuro-inspired systems, but there are still limitations that prevent their practical application on portable devices. This work will investigate novel materials and designs that can alleviate these limitations, enabling a better execution of critical mathematical functions. The scientific breakthroughs resulting from this work will support robust, efficient, and massively parallel computing for data-intensive machine learning applications. A profound societal impact will be achieved by laying the foundations for novel computing hardware that will support cognitive systems and artificial intelligence of tomorrow. Another objective of this project is to integrate research and education by training students (including graduate and undergraduate researchers), by developing educational tools in form of web-based interactive platforms, and by supporting a graduate-level course in the topic of novel integrated memory and neuro-inspired computing architectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will establish the foundations of new storage technology based on two-dimensional (2-D) atomically-thin materials, extending the practical engineering limits of neuro-inspired systems. These storage devices, known as memristors, can be programmed to different states, based on an externally applied stimulus. When organized in specific configurations, memristor arrays can be used to implement complex functions that are used by the system in a decision-making process. However, because of randomness in the operation of memristors, variation is inevitable, affecting the accuracy of the computation and the trustworthiness of the system-based decisions. This work aims to combine novel 2-D materials with new array configurations to mitigate the impact of variability in order to improve accuracy and performance of computation, while maintaining the benefits of low-energy consumption. The intellectual significance of this project extends from fundamental science relating to atomic-scale storage in 2-D materials, to applied engineering contributions relating to the demonstration of robust memristor arrays for neuro-inspired computing applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001625.xml,Collaborative Research: A Novel Biological Valorization of Hydrothermal Liquefaction Wastewater with Marine Protist and its Granulated Phenotype,NSF,2020-07-01,2025-06-30,120000,"Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) has been considered as a promising thermal processing approach to biofuel production from a broad range of organic matter, including agricultural waste biomass, municipal solid waste, and algae.  A recent U.S. Department of Energy report stated that as much as 5.9 billion gallons of biocrude could be produced each year in the U.S. from the available waste organic matter using HTL technology; this biocrude can be further refined to liquid transportation fuels using processes similar to conventional petroleum refining, replacing those fuels currently produced from non-renewable feedstocks. However, current HTL processes produce a large amount of wastewater containing high concentrations of organic compounds and nutrients; the sustainable disposal of this wastewater is one of the most significant bottlenecks to the scale-up and commercialization of HTL. This research will address concerns from both environmental and energy conversion efficiency perspectives of HTL by recovering organic carbon and nutrients from HTL wastewater. This is a critical step to increasing the net energy yield and enhancing the economic viability and environmental sustainability of HTL processes. In the course of carrying out this project, the researchers will train the next generation of scientists and engineers in biofuel production, biotechnology/bioprocessing, and environmental stewardship, all while educating the public about sustainable biofuel production and the impact of energy consumption on economic, environmental and societal sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team of this proposal has recently found that a marine protist Thraustochytrium striatum HB can survive and grow in wastewater produced from HTL processing of municipal solid waste without supplemental nutrients while removing approximately 80% total organic carbon, 100% total nitrogen, and 80% phosphorus. Additionally, the microbes were found to be tolerant of wide pH and salinity ranges (comparable to sea water) in metabolizing organic compounds in HTL wastewater while being able to form cell aggregates under harsh conditions. Therefore, marine protists hold promise to be a new class of superior microorganisms for HTL wastewater treatment and valorization. The overarching goal of this project is to establish a T. striatum HB-facilitated platform for HTL wastewater valorization to enable sustainable HTL for biofuel production. The specific objectives of this research are to: (1) elucidate the correlation between biocrude yield and the HTL wastewater composition; (2) reveal the metabolic adaptation of T. striatum HB to the new wastewater environments to enhance overall energy return and biocrude yield; and (3) explore the formation mechanisms of T. striatum HB biogranules and the resulting performance impact on HTL wastewater valorization since biogranules are more efficient in wastewater valorization compared to dispersed cells. The marine protists could be a new class of promising microorganisms for valorization of other types of high-strength wastewater. The interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research will facilitate the integration of research and educational plans to enhance the education programs of three institutes involved in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002692.xml,Search for new phases of the exotic superfluid 3He under nanoconfinement,NSF,2020-06-01,2024-05-31,490000,"Non-technical Abstract<br/>Most consumer items utilize technology that emerged because of advances in condensed matter research. Future advances will be enabled by the sort of “curiosity driven” exploration of new regimes accessible only in a laboratory environment. The research to be conducted in this program will examine the special properties of superfluid 3He when confined in precisely defined structures less than a thousandth of a millimeter tall, marking the transition from bulk so-called 3 dimensional behavior to a new 2 dimensional regime. Undergraduate students and a Ph.D student will build on cutting edge knowledge to design and fabricate these structures opening up a new area of quantum nano-fluidics.  The surfaces will have to have a well-defined smoothness since the smoothness (alterable with a coating of helium 4) changes the scattering at the surface much like a mirrored surface is different from a frosted surface. This scattering quality (together with the confinement) can also change the types of superfluid states (“phases”) that emerge. These phases should show a property “chirality” that should have properties like a spinning top. These new phases should exhibit novel characteristics such as highly conducting “edge states” that are scientifically “exciting” and that could, in the future form the basis of new types of devices for metrology and computation. Past graduate students and undergraduates of this team have gone on to productive careers in academia, high-technology industries and the financial sector, and the planned research will prepare a new generation of students for challenging careers. <br/><br/>Technical abstract:<br/>Superfluid 3He can inform research activity that extends across many fields in Physics. The project combines nanofluidics (intricate and precisely fabricated silicon cavities with sizes tuned to the scale of the superfluid’s coherence length) with low temperature physics, to expose new size effects. The experimental activity will probe excitations using transport (superfluid density and heat conductivity) as well as novel noise thermometry and a nanowire to act as local thermometers. Researchers expect that entirely new p-wave superfluid states can be stabilized by such confinement and the balance between the superfluid ground state that preserves (3He-B) or breaks (3He-A) time reversal symmetry will also be affected by confinement. By measuring the phase diagram of confined 3He, details of the pressure and temperature dependence of the strong coupling strength will be mapped out allowing for more reliable prediction of the phase diagrams of 3He under confinement. Confinement will also provide the means to study the surface/edge excitations emerging as a result of bulk/edge correspondence. Studies of the hysteresis in the first-order transition between the confined A and B phases (radically different from nucleation in bulk) will challenge current understanding of these quantum transitions. New geometries will explore the physics of quantum transport across single and multiple interfaces. By combining low temperatures and nano fabrication, graduate students and undergraduates will be exposed to the exciting training ground that has prepared scientists for lead roles in academia and high-technology industries. Eventually, the new superfluids that emerge under confinement might be of interest in quantum computation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Even with knowledge of the properties of each individual component, these interactions create a challenge for predicting how changing one enzyme will affect the performance of the whole pathway and the growth of the organism. While synthetic biology has the potential to address certain critical national challenges, progress is hampered by a lack of mathematical models that can be used to guide the optimization of complex biological systems. This project works to optimize the mechanisms that incorporate carbon gas into cell material in order to develop an efficient organism for generating products such as fuels or pigments. The results of the experiments will then yield a computational model capable of predicting the effects of novel combinations of genes. This project will directly lead to specific improvements in an important biotechnological platform, while simultaneously demonstrating a generic approach to using computational biology to efficiently apply the power of genome editing to a variety of synthetic biology challenges. The project also will develop and disseminate computational tools via websites, publications, workshops, and classes that will make it easier for students and researchers to simulate and analyze metabolic networks to learn about fundamental quantitative concepts that underlie their function, and provide interdisciplinary training for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Epistasis represents a critical challenge to optimizing biological systems. When mutational effects upon growth or product generation depend on the genetic background, assessing performance across the entire parameter space of any system of realistic size quickly becomes impossible. There is an immediate need for two linked developments: empirical techniques that can rapidly generate and assess rational, combinatorial variants, and kinetic modeling techniques to incorporate these data and to make predictions. This project will use this novel approach to optimize the function of the high-efficiency ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway that the team has successfully introduced into the model methanol-consuming organism, Methylobacterium extorquens. In this project, gene editing of a plasmid-encoded suite of enzymes will be performed along with deep sequencing to rapidly assess the fitnesses of a quarter-million genotypes with combinatorial variation in nine dimensions of expression.  The resulting epistasis data, combined with direct measurement of intracellular metabolite concentrations for select variant combinations, will be used to infer the numerous parameter values in the kinetic model, which then will be utilized to predict which regions of parameter space would be more or less flexible.  These parameter spaces will be targeted and compared in a second round of editing, experimentation and evaluation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."

Laboratory measurements of Earth materials (e.g., rocks, minerals, and magmas) are used in conjuction with direct observations of the planet and numerical models to help build the rich and complex view of the Earth and its inner workings that we have today. In this project, the investigators seek to further our understanding of the atomic-scale physical properties of several relevant Earth materials through the development of a very high resolution materials characterization technique called positron annihilation spectroscopy. The benefit of this technique is that it allows for direct investigation of crystalline solids at an atomic level, which is not routinely done with other conventional methods used in the geosciences. This project aims to build a new positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy apparatus, test and calibrate the instrument, and characterize the atomic scale defect populations in several important Earth materials including metals, oxides, and silicate minerals. The undertaking will involve interdisciplinary collaborations between nuclear physicists and experts in the area of materials characterization and geoscience. The project will also support two female faculty, undergraduate curriculum development, and advanced student research at a liberal arts college. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding defects in crystalline solids is important for our general understanding of Earth materials because of their relationship to atomic mobility (diffusion) within crystals, nucleation of crystals and formation of new phases as well as electrical and heat transfer properties. When a significant population of defects are included in the crystal structure, it may affect transport properties of the crystal significantly. Many crystals in natural systems may have been exposed to defect creating events including radiation damage and deformation. To accurately apply experimentally determined diffusion parameters to natural systems, a thorough understanding of the relationship between defects and diffusion is crucial. Direct measurements of defect populations in natural and synthetic Earth materials is generally lacking. Positron annihilation spectroscopy is a non-destructive technique used to characterize defects and voids in materials at a sub nm to atomic scale. The technique has been used extensively in the materials science and nuclear materials communities for decades to examine defect properties and the effects of radiation damage on synthetic and industrial materials, but has not yet gained popularity in the Earth sciences community. The goal of this project is to develop a methodology that will enable further investigation into the relationship between diffusion and defect populations by direct measurement of defects in a variety of Earth relevant materials using positron annihilation spectroscopy. The project will also contribute to the education and research training of undergraduate students and provide opportunities for interdisciplinary work between mineral physics, nuclear physics, materials science, and geochemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002737.xml,SHF: Small: Automatic Generation of Cache Coherent Memory Systems for Multicore Processors,NSF,2020-07-01,2024-06-30,400000,"Today’s computer processors are called multicore processors, because they have multiple processor cores in them, all of which can be working simultaneously on computational tasks.  These cores share data with each other using a communication protocol called cache coherence, which ensures that the data used by these cores is up-to-date and correct. Cache coherence protocols are notoriously complicated and difficult to design, and they are at least as difficult to then verify as being correct in all situations. Because of their complexity, coherence protocols take a large and disproportionate share of the design and verification resources when the computer industry creates a new processor.  Furthermore, the difficulty of designing coherence protocols is increasing as processor cores scale up in variety and number on a single chip.  This project is developing a novel tool that enables computer architects to quickly and easily design high-performance coherence protocols that are provably correct.  The tool has the potential to radically change the way that protocols are designed, in both industry and academia, and thus make processor design faster, cheaper, and more reliable.   Through an outreach program and a research fellowship program for undergraduates, the project will benefit from the contributions of women, under-represented populations, and undergraduate researchers.<br/><br/>As processor designs change--with the addition of more cores or different types of cores, or with different expected communication patterns--there are incentives to create new coherence protocols to suit these changes. Even if a new protocol is not a radical departure from previous protocols, designing it and validating it are arduous, bug-prone processes.<br/>This project is developing a novel tool, called ProtoGen+, for automating the design of verifiable cache coherence protocols. The architects need only provide simplified protocol designs that omit complexity like hierarchy and concurrent communications.  The tool takes those simplified protocol designs and automatically generates the high-performance versions of those protocols, thus hiding the complexity from the architects.  ProtoGen+ then outputs the complicated, concurrent protocol. ProtoGen+ greatly reduces design and verification effort and minimizes the number of design bugs. ProtoGen+ accommodates a wide range of protocols, including those with hierarchy and heterogeneity. ProtoGen+ also generates the virtual network assignments necessary to avoid protocol deadlock.  Two secondary objectives of the work are to explore the space of protocols that are compatible with ProtoGen+ and to produce protocols that are compatible with the previously developed Neo framework for verifiable protocol design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002620.xml,RAPID: Disaster Recovery Decision Making in Remote Tourism-dependent Communities,NSF,2020-02-15,2022-01-31,58934,"Hurricanes disrupt community vitality when significant damage and destruction occurs to the built environment, particularly in remote, tourism-dependent coastal communities. Immediately following the impacts to homes, businesses, and infrastructure, tourism business owners and employees begin to make recovery decisions that affect the resilience of coastal communities. This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project examines the factors and information networks that influence recovery decisions in Ocracoke and Hatteras, North Carolina, which were substantially impacted by Hurricane Dorian (September 2019). The remote nature of these communities makes them particularly vulnerable, as their transportation network is built upon a single state highway and/or ferry service that, when damaged, can affect access to recovery resources. Their dependence on tourism also makes them economically vulnerable as tourism benefits (e.g., jobs, tax revenues) rely on transportation access and lodging availability. Similar disaster-related impacts may become increasingly common in other coastal tourism-dependent communities due to potential increases in storm intensity and frequency in conjunction with sea-level rise. By identifying the factors and networks that influence early recovery decisions, this project contributes to NSF’s mission to advance national welfare and promote the progress of science. Specifically, this study increases the understanding of individual disaster recovery decisions within the tourism sector, which cumulatively influence a community’s ability to reestablish its built environment and economic base. This study also identifies the communication pathways that enable more informed near-term recovery decisions, which can be activated in future disaster response, tourism crisis management, and community resiliency building efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of our project is to compare the factors and information networks that influence information processing and recovery decision making in two remote post-disaster tourism-dependent communities. This project has four objectives: (1) documenting various factors that influence tourism stakeholders’ recovery decisions; (2) identifying information networks accessed by tourism stakeholders to inform recovery decisions; (3) evaluating the extent to which recovery information activated through those networks is processed; and (4) understanding decision making pathways that influence risk perceptions and intended recovery decisions. These objectives will be accomplished by integrating the Risk Information Seeking and Processing (RISP) model with Social Network Analysis (SNA) in the analysis of data generated during in-depth interviews with tourism business owners, employees, and community leaders, as well as state emergency response officials. Data will be thematically analyzed for factors and RISP model predictors that influence recovery decisions, and information networks will be mapped using SNA to identify influential pathways for recovery decision making. Additionally, community-level data will be compared to identify if, and how, varying infrastructure damage and access to recovery resources impact decision making, which will enhance the transferability of our findings. Collecting these data in a near-term post-disaster context is critical, as the state of a tourism destination (e.g., availability of recovery funds, others’ recovery decisions) impacts the availability of future decision options. The findings will reveal the factors and information pathways that influence disaster recovery decisions in a synergistic examination of business and household recovery decisions. More specifically, the findings will identify the ways in which information processing of current and prior experiences, perceptions of workforce capacity and recovery of the built environment, network support availability, and anticipated tourism demand influence recovery decision making, as well as expose capacity needs to maintain the tourism industry in near-term, post-disaster contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research aims at advancing our limited knowledge on the design and development of commodity polymers that exhibit self-healing properties. An ultimate goal is the development of new generation of inexpensive polymeric materials that are capable of autonomous self-healing. The planned research will impact fields of polymer and materials science, polymer engineering and processing, as well as technologically related fields. It is envisioned that existing polymers and devices made out of these materials will last longer while sustaining useful functions. The significance and importance of the proposed research lies in numerous critical applications of low-cost materials in the energy, healthcare, and homeland security sectors, all of which are vital to US global competitiveness. This project will develop scientific protocols on how to design polymeric materials with sustainable and useful functions by imbedded self-healing properties. These studies will involve design and preparation of thermoplastic commodity polymers that are capable of self-healing. Such prepared materials will be tested for mechanical and chemical integrity during damage-repair cycles in the presence and absence of water. The output of the tests will be used to perform computer simulations in an effort to understand underlying processes of self-healing. Through the integration of research and education, a new generation of diversified graduate students who will become productive members of society will be educated. This training will include addressing fundamental scientific questions on how commodity plastics can be equipped with self-healing functions so they become sustainable and minimize waste plastics accumulation.<br/><br/> <br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to equip commodity copolymers with self-healing properties which will be accomplished by understanding the role of copolymer compositional and structural dependences on self-healing.

To help keep pace with these advances, this project plans to develop a pipeline from high school through college and into the automotive technician workforce.  Students in the pipeline will be able to earn certificates or an Associate of Science degree in Automotive Technology.  In addition, faculty will update their knowledge about innovations in automobile design and function, so they can improve their courses. The project includes collaborations with local industry to expand student opportunities and meet the needs of local businesses.  By educating current and future automotive technicians, the project will provide access to a well-paying profession.  As a result, this project has the potential to have strong, positive impacts for the rural, high poverty community in which the project is situated.  <br/><br/>This project is grounded in a professional learning exchange among students, faculty, and master automotive dealership technicians. The project will enable participants to move as a cohort through a curricular pathway with integrated support services to boost retention and completion rates. Aspects of this support include a tailored First Year Experience course, a dedicated academic counselor, and general education classes with automotive themes. Students will earn an Associate of Science degree and/or certificates in automotive technology that meet both industry preparation standards and the needs of local employers. As part of their education, students will complete eighteen months of on-the-job learning in local dealerships and have opportunities to earn industry recognized certifications.  The education program will prepare students for the industry-recognized Automotive Service Excellence certification test for master technicians. Local dealerships are the leading employer of automotive technicians and the proposed project will formalize newly created partnerships between the college and these businesses. For example, automotive technology faculty members will perform externships alongside dealership technicians, thus allowing faculty to increase their knowledge of and their ability to incorporate technical advances into their courses. Representatives of local automotive dealerships will serve on an advisory committee and as professional experts in the college classroom.

2002987.xml,Collaborative Research: The saboteur's tools: mechanisms for host reproductive manipulation by the bacterial arthropod endosymbiont Cardinium hertigii,NSF,2020-06-15,2024-08-31,359952,"Most insects carry bacteria that live within their cells; these bacteria are inherited from their mothers. The bacteria may manipulate their insect hosts’ reproduction in ways that improves the health or number of female hosts carrying the bacterium. Relevant to this study, these bacterial “symbionts” can sabotage host sperm such that fertilized eggs laid by females without the bacterium die early in life (“cytoplasmic incompatibility,” or “CI”). Currently, two common, unrelated bacteria are known to cause CI in insects: Wolbachia, and Cardinium hertigii, the focus of this study. The main goal of this project is to discover the molecular mechanism by which Cardinium causes CI in insects. The benefits of this work are at least two-fold. Bacteria such as Cardinium target animal cell division, a fundamental process that can be understood better when examining how Cardinium interferes with it. Secondly, CI-causing bacteria may be used for pest or vector management. The CI agent Wolbachia reduces the susceptibility to viruses of insects that carry it, and is currently being introduced around the world to mosquito populations, with major implications for reduction of vector-borne disease and the global bioeconomy. The project will also provide engaging science education targeted for under-represented groups through outreach programs for elementary school (U Arizona Insect Discovery and Insect Festival), high school (production of a book “Animal Manipulating Parasites at NC State, and Iowa State George Washington Carver Internship program) and undergraduate students (via research opportunities at all three institutions). <br/><br/>For Cardinium strains that infect Encarsia spp., parasitic wasps of whiteflies, genomic and transcriptomic studies have identified candidate genes that are likely to be important in CI and/or symbiosis. The central hypotheses are that (1) Cardinium effector proteins involved in modifying host DNA during spermatogenesis are associated with the testes, and other Cardinium effectors involved with rescue of modified sperm are present in the ovaries of infected wasps, (2) the role of these proteins can be inferred by identifying the host proteins they interact with and (3) that the B vitamin biotin has a critical role in CI and/or the symbiosis. The project presents a unique opportunity to test these hypotheses with a diverse array of approaches, in four objectives: (1) Compare Cardinium localization and CI candidate gene expression in male pupal Encarsia, the “modification” stage, with patterns observed in adults.(2) Identify Cardinium and Encarsia proteins involved in CI with differential proteomics. (3) Use heterologous expression to identify interacting host proteins of CI candidate proteins. (4) Investigate the role of Cardinium synthesized biotin in modification of host proteins. This project will shed light on the sophisticated CI reproductive manipulation by Cardinium. Cardinium has received comparatively little attention, but produces a virtually identical CI phenotype to Wolbachia with what appears to be completely independent eukaryote-interacting genes, a plasmid and not a phage, and an unusual type 6 secretion system. What is learned about Cardinium candidate gene function, expression and host targets will illuminate CI and symbiosis in both systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2000222.xml,Magnetic Reconnection in Kinetic Turbulent Plasmas,NSF,2020-04-01,2024-03-31,589734,"Understanding the close interconnection between turbulence and magnetic reconnection has been of increasing importance to the broader solar and space physics community.  Turbulence is a fundamental physical process of transferring energy from large-scale motions to small kinetic scales, where the turbulence energy is dissipated as plasma heat and particle energization.  Magnetic reconnection is a universal physical process that converts magnetic energy to plasma kinetic and thermal energies.  Both processes critically influence the dynamics and energetics in systems such as the solar corona, solar wind, and planetary magnetospheres.  Magnetic reconnection has been observed in turbulent environments such as the solar wind and the Earth's magneto-sheath.  It has been suggested to contribute to energy dissipation of the turbulence and changes in the turbulent cascade by spacecraft observations, simulations and theory.  Present knowledge on the physics underlying how magnetic reconnection influences turbulence, and vice versa, is at the very early stages of development.  In this regard, the main purpose of this 3-year research project is to improve the physical understanding of the interconnection between magnetic reconnection and turbulence.  The main goal of the project is to develop a new technique for identifying and examining reconnection activity using gyro-kinetic simulations of plasma turbulence.  The project will support the research of an early-career female scientist, and it will provide research opportunities to undergraduate students at Dartmouth College.  These are vital for the education and training of the next generations of scientists, thus contributing to a more diverse STEM workforce in the U.S. The outcome of this research project is expected to yield an improved understanding of the connection between magnetic reconnection and space plasma turbulence, hence leading to more accurate modeling and predictions of the space weather conditions surrounding the Earth.  This will contribute to the stability, economy, and technology advancement of the society --- both nationally and globally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 3-year research project has three science objectives. The first objective is to identify active reconnecting X-points in fully non-linear kinetic turbulence.  The second objective is to examine the properties of magnetic reconnection in Alfvenic turbulence.  The third objective is to assess the role of reconnection in the heating of magnetized turbulence.  The project is directly relevant to the NSF's Solar-Terrestrial Research program, because it would provide important knowledge and an innovative technique for understanding the nature of turbulence and reconnection in space and astrophysical plasmas.  This knowledge will be critical for the modeling and predictions of space weather from the surface of the Sun to the Earth and beyond.  The new technique will be applicable for analyzing spacecraft data from missions such as MMS, Parker Solar Probe, and Solar Orbiter.

However, the spatial pattern of glacial-interglacial climate and environmental variability in the tropics underscores the need for longer and better constrained data sets from the region to fully understanding forcings and potential feedbacks. The tropics play a crucial role in global moisture balance and heat redistribution. Additionally, environmental change in continental systems is also generally greater in amplitude and more spatially heterogeneous than in marine environments, where many of the early records of tropical climate variability are located. Thus, terrestrial records from the tropics are particularly necessary to fully resolve regional variability of glacial-interglacial climate variability and for comparison to existing high latitude records. This project will contribute to an enhanced understanding of Neotropical paleoclimate over the last 400 thousand years, and will illuminate temperature, hydroclimate, and vegetation shifts for a key location in Central America, Lake Petén Itzá. The researchers will mentor students in scientific communication with the broader public, focusing on the societal relevance of paleoclimate research, and will develop a paleoclimate-based, data-integrated exercise that will be used for hands-on undergraduate classes. Additionally, the project team will develop an open-access article describing paleoclimate science in an online journal aims to inspire and educate the next generation of scientists, reaching a large global student audience.<br/><br/>Lake Petén Itzá, Guatemala, lies in a region dominated by trade wind migration and is influenced by sea surface temperature changes in the subtropical Atlantic basin. It thus represents a key spatial node for understanding large-scale climate variability of the northern tropics of the Americas. The investigators will use existing, archived drill cores from Lake Petén Itzá to develop records of changing Neotropical temperature (using brGDGTs) and precipitation (using δD values of leaf waxes), and the response of terrestrial vegetation (using δ13C values of leaf waxes) to these changes, in order to examine climate and ecosystem evolution over the past 400 ka. The investigators will integrate findings from the organic geochemical sedimentary reconstructions with previously published and currently on-going sedimentological and palynological research from Petén Itzá. Proxy-model comparison work will also be completed using these integrated reconstructions and other regionally available records with water isotope-enabled GCM experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Just about all life on Earth exists due to intricate interactions that produce or allow for the production of food, medicine, shelter, fiber, fuel through pollination, decomposition, nutrient cycling and more. The cascading consequences of ecosystem shifts on these interactions and products can be understood by examining species distribution and diversity, as well as physical variation within and among species across a geographic range, in relation to environmental factors. Natural history collections hold such information and are a record of what happened yesterday to millions of years ago. These research collections can reveal putative reasons for past events, from which predictions about the future direction ecosystems may take and preparations for potentially volatile outcomes can be made. However, the details in these collections, some dating back 150 years or more, are often recorded on a minute slip of paper tied to a wing, tucked in the grooves of a bone or pierced with a pin underneath a collected insect. To unlock the secrets of the past for the benefit of the future, taxonomic, locality, time, and associated environmental condition collection information must be transcribed into digital form to be available for analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Symbiota Collection of Arthropods Network Thematic Collection Network (SCAN TCN) has digitized specimens of select ground-dwelling insects collected from the southwestern U.S. and Mexico from 16 U.S. institutions. As a Partner to the Existing Network (PEN), the Division of Invertebrate Zoology (IZ) of the American Museum of Natural History will contribute data from 53,800 ground-dwelling roach (‘Blattaria’), earwig (Dermaptera), cricket and grasshopper (Orthoptera) specimens representing ca. 310 species in the AMNH collection. Tools such as automated image cropping and optical character recognition and help of volunteer citizen scientists are integral to this effort, an often slow and tedious process for old, handwritten labels no larger than a centimeter.  The result will be a more complete and robust understanding of species diversity and representation of current and past ecosystems and the impact of natural and anthropogenic activities. Localities will be georeferenced so specimens can be mapped in space and time, species distributions can be refined and models of distributional, ecological and diversity changes can be improved. High resolution images of exemplar males, females, alternative morphs, and AMNH holotypes for target species will aid in species identification and comparison. Additional images of earwig cerci (hind pincers) and expanded grasshopper hindwings will be available for data visualization projects.

One effect of this warming is that permafrost, which is ground that remains frozen even in summer, is now thawing. Permafrost thaw exposes previously frozen organic soil material to decomposition, a process that releases carbon dioxide to the world’s atmosphere and can contribute to the greenhouse effect. Thaw also brings new amounts of soil and carbon material into Arctic rivers, which then gets deposited in floodplains and coasts. How the transport of this soil and carbon through river corridors and the burial of this material on the coasts, affect carbon decomposition is unclear.  This project collects data that will monitor changes in water and carbon chemistry for the Canning River in Alaska.  These measurements from the land surface, floodplain and river banks, will allow us to develop new theories about the carbon cycle. These new insights will be used to develop computer models that predict future landscape change and carbon release. The project will help build the future workforce through training of four students and a postdoctoral fellow in integrated data collection and computer modeling. We will share our insights with the public through a short film. We will also work with regional decision makers through close collaboration with the US Geological Survey, Fish and Wildlife Service, and at the National Park Service.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Limited understanding of the mechanisms of sediment production in seasonally frozen landscapes, of transport, storage, and transformation of sediment and carbon along river corridors, and deposition at the coasts, prevents us from predicting Arctic carbon cycles into the future. This project addresses the geomorphic transport system and its connection to organic carbon liberation and sequestration. The study tracks sediment and carbon geochemical characteristics through the conveyor system of the Canning River on Alaska’s North Slope, from its glacial headwaters in the Brooks Range to its delta in the Beaufort Sea.  We will develop new theory and quantitative numerical models. Field efforts, which include the establishment of time-lapse cameras along the Canning River, high resolution morphological change mapping using drones and the new Arctic Digital Elevation Model, deployment of temperature and sediment transport sensors, and the collection of water, sediment and carbon samples, will shed light on the magnitudes of sediment and carbon fluxes from the terrestrial domain to the coastal Arctic Ocean.  These measurements will provide a baseline data set against which future change can be assessed. The study will address hillslope sediment transport by solifluction, thaw-controlled fluvial sediment transport, sediment comminution by frost cracking, thermal riverbank erosion, and deltaic deposition in a sea-ice-covered ocean. The numerical schemes developed in this project will improve existing open-source model frameworks for simulating high latitude, hydrology, biogeochemistry, and morpho-dynamics.

They tell us what kinds of plants were present, where those plants were, and when the plants were there.  With this information we can track changes over time, such as the return of wildflowers and forest trees to previously farmed land, and the introduction and spread of invasive plant species.  Herbarium specimens are also records of past seasonal events such as when wildflowers bloomed, and when trees leafed out in the spring and dropped their leaves in fall.

Increased development and urbanization in fire-prone areas, coupled with evolving climate changes, have significantly increased the vulnerability of human communities and ecosystems to wildfires. Even with large expenditures for fire suppression efforts, annual economic losses, as well as loss of human life, due to wildfires remain high.  This award supports research efforts to reduce wildfire activity by developing cost-effective methods to reduce risk through fuel treatment.  Fuel treatment involves removing vegetation (i.e., fuel) from a landscape to reduce the potential and severity of large-scale fires.  Fuel treatment, which forms a first line of wildfire defense, may include any combination of controlled burning, grazing, and various types of mechanical thinning.  This award will contribute to better understanding of what types of fuel treatment options and associated decision-making strategies are more appropriate for particular fire-prone regions.  This project will involve both graduate and undergraduate students as well as development of courses that expose students at all levels to quantitative methods to address large-scale societal problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support research into new sequential mixed-integer optimization methods to determine the appropriate location, timing and type of fuel treatments over multiple seasons in order to minimize the expected losses from wildfires in a region. The optimization framework will involve formulating and solving non-linear mathematical programming models for fuel accumulation and reduction under resource constraints. To take into account the inherent uncertainties with respect to fire ignition, the approach employs robust optimization techniques.  The project will investigate analytical results that describe important structural properties of the models and will develop specialized numerical algorithms to solve realistically-sized instances of the problem. The algorithms will leverage and extend modern techniques at the intersection of robust and combinatorial optimization. The models will be calibrated and validated using historical data from the Texas A&amp;M Forest Service, a state agency charged with overseeing forest management in the state of Texas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The brain consists of millions of neurons that are interconnected and form distinct circuits that transmit signals in coordinated manners. To analyze how neural circuit activity lead to behavior, neuroscientists rely on technologies to manipulate and track signal transmission of neurons in live animals. This project aims to develop strategies to form a novel interfacing device technology capable of chronically stable, optical, multi-regional, and bi-directional neural communication in behaving animals. Successful development of the flexible neural interfacing device would enable newfound understanding of the mechanism of human brain functions, as well as improved treatment protocols for neuropsychological diseases such as the Parkinson’s disease. Another aim of this project is to create a new course on bioelectronics that include intensive lab modules on layer-transfer processes for thin-film electronic devices, aimed at providing K-12 to graduate students opportunities to apply textbook theories to research laboratory settings or industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The state-of-the-art neurotechnologies rely on optical fibers or miniaturized microscopes to deliver light to and from the animal’s brain, which is engineered to produce proteins that make neurons interact with light at specific wavelengths.

This project aims to address these issues by developing a novel semiconductor-based optical brain-machine interface via the heterointegration of thin-film III-V optoelectronic devices in flexible geometries. Integration of freestanding, single-crystalline layers of micro-LEDs and photodetectors can yield a novel device platform capable of simultaneous optogenetic neuromodulation and functional recording in behaving mouse brains.

In algebraic geometry, mathematicians are interested in the classification of algebraic varieties, that is, sets of solutions to polynomial equations. This classification is carried out by determining and computing certain invariants of the variety. Such invariants can be numerical, or more often, sets that have a specific algebraic or geometric structure. The more geometric approach focuses on algebraic varieties over the complex numbers, which themselves have a rich geometry. In number theory, on the other hand, mathematicians are interested in finding integer or rational solutions to polynomial equations; a famous example in this area is Fermat's last theorem. The set of rational numbers is very scarce within the set of complex numbers, which is what makes such solutions so hard to detect. This project aims to study a geometric invariant, called the Chow group of zero-cycles, that relates both to the classification problem and to the arithmetic of rational solutions. The main goal of the project is to investigate conjectures that deal with the structure of this group when we work over the rational numbers or over the arithmetic analog of the real numbers, namely the p-adic numbers. <br/><br/>The methods in this project will involve techniques from arithmetic and algebraic geometry as well as K-theory. The project focuses on the study of abelian varieties, a class of varieties that has some extra structure. The project involves ""local questions"" for varieties over the p-adic numbers, where the use of p-adic Hodge theory will be the key. Among the main goals of the local program is to establish a conjecture of Colliot-Thélène. Second, the project involves also ""global questions"" for varieties over the rational numbers. The goal of the global program will be to prove a conjecture of Beilinson. Lastly, the project will investigate a ""local-to-global"" program related to obstruction questions. The goal is to prove a conjecture of Kato and Saito, which could potentially lead to the construction of a new type of Euler system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2003057.xml,Heteromolecular Interface Design for Better Multiferroic Molecular Spintronics,NSF,2020-07-15,2023-06-30,486234,"Nontechnical Description<br/>This project focuses on the interface between a class of molecules which are magnetic, but where the magnetic properties can be turned on and off, and a different group of molecules whose properties are easily altered by voltage. The overall research goals are to better understand the mechanisms that dominate the voltage manipulation of an unusual class of molecules that can be flipped between being magnetic or not magnetic. There are good reasons to pursue this better understanding. Suitable combinations of molecules, that can be toggled between a state acting like a very small magnet and one having no magnetism, with molecules whose intrinsic properties can be controlled by an applied voltage make it possible to fabricate a molecular ""switch"" that requires very little power to turn on and off. By choosing the right molecule from each class, novel, low cost and extremely low power electronic devices can be made, that can be switched on and off billions of times without degradation. These are devices that can be reduced to the size of a virus particle, or even smaller, which could lead to super high dense computer memories. The cost is low since molecular films can be printed on a wide variety of surfaces. The investigators, having developed this new technology, intend to explore the principles for designing novel and even better molecular materials where magnetism and voltage are intertwined. Student training will include direct international experience in science. Other activities involve both undergraduate and graduate students, including visiting undergraduates, in cutting edge research at the interface of chemistry and physics and outreach activities where the students learn how to communicate cutting edge research to a nontechnical audience.  <br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>This research team has demonstrated voltage controlled nonvolatile transistor-like devices that use molecular spin crossover complexes as the conduction channel. In these systems, the molecular spin state can be tuned by the gate voltage, altering the magnetic properties and the conductance by orders of magnitude. This success opens the door to obtaining deeper insights into possible magneto-electric coupling in molecular systems. This research focuses on a better understanding of the mechanisms that dominate the voltage manipulation of the spin state of these metal-organic complexes. The ultimate aim of investigating suitable combinations of ferroelectric and local moment molecular systems is to find systems with super-large (large electric response to a small magnetic field) or super-small (large magnetic response to a small applied voltage) magneto-electric coefficients. But the core of this research is how intermolecular interaction affects intramolecular configurations, resulting in changes to the ligand field, the molecular dipole, and ultimately the spin state. To accomplish this goal, the investigators will  (1) identify what determines the changes in spin crossover phenomenology with molecular film thickness; (2) determine the energy barriers to spin state switching; (3) learn how a heteromolecular system, where the spin state of the molecular overlayer is altered by an applied electric field, reacts to competing processes; (4) identify the smallest controllable domain size within a continuous film; and (5) identify whether or not a spin orientation anisotropy barrier exists. The combined molecular systems will be characterized by a variety of spectroscopic techniques, magnetometry and scanning probe techniques to determine spin state, ferroelectric polarization, as well as spin crossover activation energies, while thin film heterostructure conductance and magnetic moment will be characterized in the presence of applied magnetic and electric fields at various temperatures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This project will consider a class of complex molecularly branched ionic polymers with various chemical compositions, morphologies and tunable physical properties in order to understand composition-structure-property relationships and enhance ion-group mobility.  These novel ion-containing polymeric materials will be synthesized to contain a high concentration of well-ordered charged groups.  They will be processed into continuous morphologies and investigated by various advanced techniques.  This approach will provide an organized material platform with potentially high and controlled ionic transport, as well as liquid electrolytes with low temperature and mechanical stability.  Such organized multi-functional polymeric materials with controlled continuous morphologies are important for prospective novel solid polyelectrolyte media.  These could offer potential for new lightweight, robust, temperature-stable, and safe batteries to replace current liquid-based batteries.  This research will be integrated with a multifaceted educational program for graduate and undergraduate students, as well as outreach to high school students and the general public to cultivate their interest in nanomaterials and more broadly STEM careers.   <br/><br/><br/>PART 2.  TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This project will consider newly synthesized branched poly(ionic liquid)s with different functional cores, ion species, and degrees of ionization.  The PI's group will explore different chemical architectures to promote various micellar morphologies and their assembly into continuous percolated networks across multiple spatial scales starting from individual macromolecules and extending to the formation of long-range interconnected anisotropic core-shell morphologies.  The project is focused on understanding the role of highly asymmetric compositions of new multicomponent branched ion-containing polymers.  These will be tailored to yield continuous domain morphologies via emergence of long-range and network organization such as expanded interconnected cylindrical and nanotubular micelles.  The general hypothesis of the proposed research is that branched macromolecular architectures with multiple functionalities can be leveraged to mediate the organization of poly(ionic liquid)s and guide their assembly into predictable, percolated morphologies of interconnected domains that are distinct from those normally encountered in discrete nanostructures.

""Gone Fishing"" is a series of regular meetings in North America where mathematicians interested in Poisson geometry and its applications meet and discuss new ideas and results. These workshops aim to promote interaction between mathematicians, physicists and groups working on related areas from different points of view, and bring together leading experts and young researchers in these subjects to encourage more interaction and cross fertilization between different fields.

2001915.xml,Doctoral Dissertation Research: The Diffusion of Democratic Norms: Examining How Democracy INGO Strategies Contribute to Hybrid Regimes,NSF,2020-02-15,2022-08-31,15845,"As a governmental system, democracy produces an environment where fundamental freedoms are respected and fulfilled, and promotes both peace and prosperity, as well as individual well-being.  In pursuit of these ends, democracy aid is dispensed by various actors including democracy-promoting international non-governmental organizations (DINGOs). Such aid has skyrocketed, with 2008 global expenditures nearing $20 billion. Yet the success of this endeavor remains unclear because at the same time, hybrid regimes – governments that co-opt democratic institutions and policies to mask authoritarian practices – are proliferating. Moreover, aid is often ineffective, and typical aid strategies can incentivize superficial democratization while legitimizing and reinforcing nondemocratic rule. Thus, DINGOs themselves may contribute to hybrid growth. However, the role of DINGOs and their strategies regarding hybrids and democratization is underexplored. This project empirically examines how nations’ ties to DINGOs impact their level of democracy in policy and practice, as well as how various types of DINGO aid strategies improve or reduce DINGO effectiveness in promoting democracy. As such, the project assesses how democracy aid influences hybrid regimes. By identifying factors relevant for democracy promotion, this project will help various actors such as nonprofits and governments safeguard human rights and improve citizen well-being worldwide. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project combines statistical and computational methodologies to examine DINGOs’ impact on democratic policies and practices cross-nationally in five-year intervals from 1980 to 2015. It uses content analysis of the Yearbook of International Organizations to count nations’ annual DINGO ties for each selected year. It then employs random effects regression to understand how those ties impact democracy in policy and in practice cross-nationally and longitudinally, using a novel measure of democracy. It further investigates this relationship by analyzing 30 DINGOs’ annual reports using one type of automated content analysis, Latent Dirichlet Application (LDA) topic modeling, to quantify which strategies DINGOs pursue, and to what degree. Finally, it draws upon these data to analyze how DINGO impact on democracy varies by DINGO strategy cross-nationally and over time using random effects regression. This design thus makes it possible to examine and compare, for the first time, the direct effects of DINGOs on democracy in policy and in practice, and how aid strategy modifies this relationship. Findings will inform sociological theories regarding democracy promotion and comparative governmental organization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002910.xml,RUI: Crystallography-Guided Synthesis of DNA-Encapsulated Silver Clusters Chromophores,NSF,2020-09-01,2024-08-31,400000,"The Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program along with the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Chemistry Division supports Professor Jeffrey T. Petty at Furman University to control and fine-tune the colors and emissions of nanoscale metal chromophores (color-producing molecules) using DNA strands as scaffolds. This research impacts the burgeoning area of metal-linked DNA constructs that expand the genetic code of DNA for optical sensing and imaging applications.  Metals are widely used in society due to their high conductivity, malleability, and reflectivity.  As metal particles shrink to nanometer dimensions of 1000 times smaller than the thickness of a human hair, their electrons reorganize and new properties emerge.  For example, although bulk silver is highly reflective, clusters of a few-atoms of silver have diverse colors that depend on the cluster size, shape, and charge. Through the combined expertise of Professor Petty at Furman University along with Professors Raquel Lieberman and Robert Dickson at the Georgia Institute of Technology, atomic-resolution structures of nanoscale DNA-silver clusters are measured with X-ray diffraction.  The electronic organization of the nanoscale structures are probed over nano- to milli-second time scales with laser-precision.  The educational broader impact of the project centers on the mentoring and training of undergraduate students at Furman University, a primarily undergraduate institution, through a comprehensive research experience.  Furman undergraduate students spearhead their individual research projects through close collaboration with graduate students and faculty from major research universities such as the Georgia Institute of Technology and the University of Münster.<br/><br/>With this support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program and the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program, Professor Petty’s team at Furman University develops DNA-silver cluster chromophores using a structure-guided approach.  Silver clusters with ~10 atoms are stabilized by DNA strands, and the spectra and photophysics of these adducts are encoded via the DNA nucleobases.  To date, DNA-silver cluster chromophores have been empirically developed for specific sensing and imaging applications.  A recent atomic-level structure of a DNA-silver cluster complex identifies three structural motifs that show how the silvers and DNA are organized. A DNA dimer with two A2C4 strands traps eight silver atoms that are arranged as in the Big Dipper asterism. A subset of five silver atoms mimics the dipper because they have a trapezoid shape. These are separated by metallic bond distances and are likely the chromophoric core of the green-emitting complex. The three other silver atoms resemble the dipper handle because they disperse between pairs of cytosines and join the DNA strands. These three bonding motifs are selectively modified by borrowing tools from chemistry and biochemistry. The modification tools are for chemically modifying nucleobase heteroatoms, enzymatically excising nucleobases, and synthetically linking DNA strands. The electronic environment of the resulting clusters is comprehensively characterized via steady-state, time-resolved, and chirooptical spectroscopies.  DNA-cluster conjugates with distinctive spectra are characterized by mass spectrometry to determine the numbers and distributions of silver atoms within the complex. These species are then screened using a wide range of solution conditions to form crystals and analyzed by X-ray diffraction to establish the relationship between the DNA-silver bonding and silver cluster spectra.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will develop novel computational tools to identify PTM sites and to predict the effects of mutations to peroxidases. The bioinformatics tools and databases developed in this program will be expected to have broader applications in broad biology research and machine learning community. In addition to the new computational tools and biological knowledge, this project will encourage  the participation of underrepresented minority students to STEM research. The creation of the Machine Learning course section and Big Data club will help students from HBCUs develop solid foundations for genetics and bioinformatics. The outreach activities, which include the involvement of students in research training activities, workshops and seminars, will help minority students develop essential skills in Big Data analytics. <br/><br/><br/>The project will investigate the effects of rare mutations and PTM sites in peroxidases using bioinformatics tools and experimental approaches. Novel bioinformatics approaches will be developed to predict mutation effects and PTM sites, and to analyze the effects of peroxidase rare mutations involved in PTMs in Human and Drosophila through three objectives: 1) Tool Development: new biological sequence features and machine learning algorithms will be used to develop bioinformatics tools for predicting protein sumoylation sites and the effects of missense mutations on protein stability; 2) Bioinformatics Analysis: sequence-based machine learning predictors will be designed to discover the rare damaging mutations, predict the effects of mutations on protein stability, and identify the mutations involved in PTMs, with a structure-based energy calculation to quantify the energy changes to assess the effects of mutations on peroxidase structure and function; and 3) Experimental Validation: biological impacts of PTM-related mutations in curly suppressor (Cysu), a heme peroxidase involved in the wing expansion and the maturation process in Drosophila, will be assessed. Genome editing tools will be used to generate mutant flies and to test neuronal functions of homologues to inspect their contributions to the phenotypes of Cysu transgenic flies. The new bioinformatics and experimental methods used in this study will provide useful information for characterizing the functional effects of rare mutations involved in PTMs in peroxidases. <br/>Results of this project, including research papers and computational tools, will be made available at http://tengbioinformatics.com/.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000135.xml,Excellence in Research: Direct synthesis of water soluble iron oxide nanoparticles with high relaxivity and interaction with small molecules,NSF,2020-07-15,2025-06-30,475000,"Nontechnical Summary:<br/><br/>This project investigates how magnetic resonance image (MRI) signals change as iron oxide nanoparticles interact with bioactive molecules. The understanding of such signal changes provides a scientific foundation to monitor drug delivery and release using MRI, which will significantly improve the treatment of diseases such as cancer as the dosage and frequency of drugs can be adjusted based on real-time drug uptake information. The major challenges of current approaches for monitoring drug delivery include lack of high sensitivity and limited tissue volume to be imaged. We overcome these challenges by synthesizing high water-soluble iron oxide nanoparticles and using them as MRI agents. MRI is a powerful imaging technique in clinical practice because it provides images with excellent details in a non-invasive, whole-body, and real-time monitoring manner. The multifunctional properties of nanoparticles provide unique advantages for the precise delivery of therapeutic agents with the assistance of imaging. The broad impacts of the project will be achieved by: (1) disseminating the knowledge obtained from this research to the science community for monitoring drug delivery where a non-invasive monitor is extremely important; (2) providing cutting-edge research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, particularly those from underrepresented students at Jackson State University (JSU); (3) promoting STEM education via exhibitions during the Mississippi Science Maker at Mississippi Museum of Nature and Science.<br/><br/>Technical summary:<br/><br/>Nanoparticles can improve drug efficacy and reduce toxicity by altering pharmacokinetics. To track the delivery behavior of drugs, fluorescent tags or radiotracers are usually attached. However, the intrinsic drawback of fluorescent tags lies in the limitation of tissue penetration of light. Availability is a significant challenge for radiotracer approaches. In comparison, iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) could be used as a self-reported drug delivery system because of their capability to change water relaxivity in tissue and their excellent biocompatibility. Despite intensive interests, the effect of bioactive molecules on the T1-weighted magnetic property of extrasmall iron oxide nanoparticles (ESIONPs) has not been studied. In addition, the T1 relaxation performance of IONPs is relatively low. The partial reason is that the monodispersal IONPs synthesized by current methods can only be dissolved in an organic solvent. A sophisticated surface modification is required to make them water soluble. In this project, a stepwise growth method will be explored to directly synthesize water soluble ESIONPs with a high T1 relaxation performance. The interaction of ESIONPs with bioactive molecules will be investigated as self-reported nano platform for drug delivery. The project will gain a fundamental understanding of T1 relaxivity of ESIONPs interacting with bioactive molecules.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The atmosphere converts pollutants by processing them into water-soluble products that are removed through precipitation (rain or snow) or by deposition onto Earth’s surface. This chemical conversion of pollution happens through a sunlight-driven (photochemical) process known as oxidation. Most of what is known about these atmospheric processes comes from measurements made at the surface in Arctic coastal environments. The CHACHA team plans to use two instrumented aircraft to conduct airborne measurements around the Chukchi Sea, the Beaufort Sea, and the Alaska North Slope region. They plan to target features that are rapidly changing - above and downwind of sea ice ""leads"" (areas of open water in otherwise sea-ice-covered ocean regions), and downwind of sources of combustion-derived pollutants. Researchers will also use collected data to develop atmospheric models that will be openly available for use by the broader scientific community. The team is composed of researchers at six United States universities (in Alaska, Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and New York) and will mentor a diverse group of students and postdoctoral scholars. Researchers will also engage in several additional education and outreach activities, including an “aircraft open house” and an annual three-day Science Fair in Utqiaġvik, AK. Overall, this project will enable the United States to better understand how rapid change in the Arctic impacts the chemical composition of the atmosphere and to translate what was learned to other regions - including the atmosphere above the world's oceans and in Earth's upper atmosphere. In addition, this project is co-funded by the Arctic Natural Sciences and Atmospheric Chemistry programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will improve understanding of atmospheric halogen chemistry in the gas, aerosol, and cloud water phases, with a focus on how that chemistry is impacted by Arctic sea ice loss and fossil fuel extraction. The CHACHA team plans to conduct eight weeks of observations during the Arctic spring, when halogen chemistry is most active, using two aircraft: the University of Wyoming King Air and the Purdue University Airborne Laboratory for Atmospheric Research (ALAR). Aircraft will conduct complementary sampling upwind and downwind of leads (sea ice fractures), over snow-covered tundra, and downwind of the North Slope of Alaska oilfields. Sampling will occur at various altitudes from the near-surface through the boundary layer and into the free troposphere. The team will prioritize measurement of various greenhouse gases (including O3, CO2, CH4, H2O), reactive trace gases (including NO2, SO2, N2O5, HO2NO2, bromine- and chlorine-containing gases), aerosol size distributions and composition, cloud residual particle composition, and cloud particle size distributions, as well as atmospheric data. These observations will be interpreted in part using 0-D and 1-D photochemical models and a cloud parcel model, to evaluate and advance understanding of multi-phase reactions and the vertical and horizontal propagation of atmospheric halogen chemistry in the Arctic. This dataset will improve understanding of the impact of the rapidly changing Arctic on halogen chemistry and atmospheric composition, as well as to provide fundamental knowledge of halogen chemistry that can be applied globally through models. The team will mentor students, postdocs, and conduct an array of unique outreach and educational activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001549.xml,Analytic Number Theory Motivated by Approximate Translation Invariance,NSF,2020-06-01,2025-05-31,500000,"Exponential sums are Fourier series encoding arithmetic information. Pointwise bounds and mean values of such sums play a fundamental role throughout analytic number theory, and contribute the primary tool for testing equidistribution (apparent ``randomness'') of sequences underpinning many applications of number theory in theoretical computer science, cryptography, and so on. Until the last decade, despite almost a century of intense effort starting with the introduction by Hardy and Littlewood of their famous circle method, the main conjectures concerning mean values of exponential sums over polynomials remained unsolved in all but the very simplest cases involving linear and quadratic polynomials. A decade of dramatic progress has culminated in the last five years with the proof of the most ambitious conjectures concerning a central example of such mean value conjectures, that associated with Vinogradov's mean value theorem, on the one hand by Bourgain, Demeter and Guth via decoupling, and on the other by the proposer by means of nested efficient congruencing. In this project, the principal investigator will enhance, extend and exploit these very recent methods so as to obtain similarly decisive progress in an array of mean value conjectures having applications in quantitative arithmetic geometry and the wider theory of the Hardy-Littlewood method. This will contribute to the resolution of the main conjectures for translation-dilation invariant systems in many variables in full generality, including analogues of such conjectures involving mean values averaged over sets of small measure, beyond the reach of current technology. A graduate student will be trained in this important emerging area, and the proposer will work on a new text intended to provide an introduction to efficient congruencing for translation-dilation invariant systems as a vehicle for introducing modern developments in the circle method over the rational integers, number fields and function fields.<br/><br/><br/>Very recent advances in the understanding of mean values of exponential sums have delivered the Main Conjecture for Vinogradov's mean value. By orthogonality, this mean value is associated with a translation-dilation invariant Diophantine system. Despite this success, neither the decoupling method nor the nested efficient congruencing method currently address any but embryonic multivariable translation-dilation invariant systems. Moreover, they do not address corresponding mean values supported on subsets of the unit hypercube, and thus fail to provide useful estimates for either minor arcs or wide sets of major arcs of use in the Hardy-Littlewood method. This project will make decisive progress on this comprehensive theory, delivering the main conjectures concerning mean values of exponential sums associated not only with general translation-dilation invariant Diophantine systems, but also systems possessing only partial or approximate translation-dilation invariant structure. This will all be done in the quite general setting of number fields and function fields by adapting the proposer’s nested efficient congruencing methods. This flexible set of methods permits congruence information to be passed from one set of variables to another in multi-homogeneous settings, and this may be achieved even when working on restricted domains of integration. Amongst applications of these new estimates, the principal investigator will establish local-global principles for the existence of rational curves with rational coefficients on hypersurfaces possessing some measure of diagonal structure via the Hardy-Littlewood method.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Various phenomena across science and engineering can be modeled by systems of polynomial equations, which leads to natural interactions with other fields such as applied mathematics, biology, computer science, and mathematical physics. For systems of polynomial equations, one studies its sets of solutions, called varieties, and the corresponding shapes they describe in high-dimensional spaces. As the number of equations and variables grow larger, one useful approach to understand these shapes is to study the algebraic functions defined on them. Using this approach, many properties such as smoothness and degrees of varieties can be translated into algebraic terms. One such strategy is to study properties of varieties by analyzing the asymptotic behavior of sequences of algebraic objects called ideals. This project contributes to this line of research with problems originating from two directions that involve the study of these properties of ideals. The PI will also be involved in mentoring students and in organizing academic events, focusing on benefiting graduate students and underrepresented groups in mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symbolic powers of an ideal encode important algebraic and geometric information of the ideal and the variety it defines. The PI will investigate the asymptotic behavior of homological invariants of symbolic powers such as, the number of generators, the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, and the projective dimension. For the sequence of numbers of generators, the PI intends to investigate if it always has polynomial complexity, building of previous results by the PI and his collaborators. A general result in this direction would have important consequences on the arithmetic rank, Frobenius complexity, and Kodaira dimension of divisors. For the other two sequences, regularities and projective dimensions, the PI will focus on regular rings of positive characteristic. In such rings, a new class of ideals is defined for which it has been previously shown the limit of these sequences exist; this class includes several types of determinantal ideals, as well as the square-free monomial ideals. The PI will investigate the existence of these limits for more general classes of ideals. The relation between multiplicities and convex bodies is an important research topic lying in the interaction of Commutative Algebra, Algebraic Geometry, and Combinatorics. In recent years, this line of research has gained much activity due to the introduction of Newton-Okounkov bodies and mixed multiplicities of filtrations of ideals. The PI and his collaborators intend to find conditions for the non-vanishing of mixed multiplicities of multigraded algebras.  The PI will also investigate a notion of mixed multiplicities for filtrations of not necessarily zero dimensional ideals and the relation of these new multiplicities with the mixed volumes of certain Newton-Okounkov bodies.&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2001946.xml,Doctoral Dissertation Research: Status Ideology: How is Status Information Interpreted?,NSF,2020-03-01,2023-02-28,16000,"Racial inequality in hiring, wages, evaluations, and promotions is a continuing issue in the contemporary United States.  We know that implicit biases advantage white job candidates over equally qualified job applicants from other racial groups.  We also know that individuals exert cognitive effort to rationalize and justify racial disparities in ways that reproduce inequality. However, little research has examined the interplay between unconscious and cognitive processes in relation to decision-making outcomes related to work. This project focuses on how individuals interpret and cognitively attend to information when evaluating job applicants’ résumés that differ on race/ethnicity and work ability to better understand how individuals interpret such information.  Project findings will inform workplace and governmental policies and practices to modify and improve hiring strategies that address inequality in evaluations relevant to key aspects of the work process. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Racial inequality at work is a partial function of both unconscious and cognitive mechanisms that are present in hiring recommendations. This project uses a mixed-methods experimental design that collects evaluations, physiological measurements and qualitative interviews. One hundred and eighty participants will review a pair of résumés that signal race/ethnicity and work ability, i.e. work skill score, a tool used by companies to diversify their hiring practices. Neurological and eye-tracking methods will be used to investigate implicit and cognitive attention during résumé evaluations and qualitative interviews will be used to observe how decisions are rationalized. A neurological approach captures evaluators’ cognitive attention when evaluating different types of information, such as race/ethnicity and work skill scores.  Eye-tracking methods will triangulate what information is implicitly capturing evaluators’ attention. Of the 180 participants, thirty randomly-selected evaluators will participate in qualitative interviews to help provide insight into the interpretive frameworks evaluators may use to justify unequal outcomes. The mixed-methods approach will demonstrate for social psychologists key strategies for studying racial inequality; for race and ethnicity scholars the project will demonstrate the power of experimentation in the laboratory.

The US electricity infrastructure is increasingly prone to climatic risks that cause wide-spread and sustained outages, costing billions of dollars annually. While natural hazard-induced failures in the transmission grid lead to large-scale and costly impacts, the existing transmission expansion planning models largely neglect resilience consideration of the network facing natural hazards. The purely data-driven approaches prevalent in resilience analytics of power distribution systems, however, are not applicable to transmission systems due to relative scarcity of data. A unilateral reliance on physics-based models is not feasible either due to their extreme computational costs, limiting their ability to scale up to the network level. This NSF grant seeks to address this fundamental gap via deep integration of physics-based and data driven methods. The outcome of this research is expected to help key decision-makers for the transmission infrastructure to characterize resilience under various uncertain future scenarios and identify optimal adaptation or mitigation strategies. The research program is complemented with educating the next generation of scholars in modeling hazards and infrastructure resilience through an interdisciplinary, research-integrated educational program, a strong commitment to increased diversity in student training and broad dissemination of the results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research approach is grounded in the latest developments in big data analytics as well as physics-based analysis of structural failures.

Novel limit state functions for failure quantification of transmission networks will be established and a scalable approach to uncertainty quantification of structural systems will be developed. The multiscale approach to modeling uncertain processes will effectively fuse data on transmission systems with computational models of the infrastructure. The developed methodologies and data will shed new lights on the vulnerability of the transmission system under future hazard scenarios, and enable assessing the impact of investment decisions on transmission system resilience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Concrete versions of this decomposition/filtering/reconstruction process, sometimes referred to as the ""time-frequency"" method, are performed in a broad range of real-world applications, such as audio or image compression, image pattern or facial recognition, data assimilation, compressed sensing and many others. A similar procedure is employed in tomographic imaging, where the shape of a solid body is reconstructed by means of sampling the body's density along penetrating waves, which can be mathematically described as lines in three dimensional space.  The first main component of this mathematics research project deals with toy mathematical models of sampling three and higher dimensional objects (for instance, solid bodies) along lower dimensional sets such as lines or planes. The second, deeply related component of this project is concerned with extending the time-frequency decomposition method to suitable vector-valued signals.

The PI will work on a novel characterization of those vector fields giving rise to a bounded directional Hilbert transform, in terms of boundedness of the related directional maximal function. The PI also proposes an array of model problems, of independent interest, obtained by constraining the range of the vector field. A novelty is that questions set up in higher dimensional ambient spaces are considered. The intrinsic multi-parameter nature of directional operators leads naturally to connected outstanding questions on the theory of double Fourier series: the parabolic and the polygonal summation problems. The second, related circle of problems investigated in this project concerns linear and multilinear singular integrals acting on Banach space valued functions: among other questions, the PI will investigate T(1)-type operator valued theorems in the multilinear setting, and fully noncommutative analogues of Carleson's theorem. The strength and relevance of operator-valued type theorems are that they self-improve to their multi-parameter analogues, which are of interest for applications and are often not attainable with direct techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2001132.xml,Hodge Filtration on Local Cohomology and Minimal Exponents,NSF,2020-06-01,2024-05-31,360000,"Given a polynomial in several variables, with complex coefficients, its solution set is a geometric object that in many interesting situations exhibits singularities. These singularities can be measured by invariants that can be either numerical or more involved (for example, they can form in turn suitable subsets in the polynomial ring). Over the past few years, the PI has been involved in the study of certain such invariants by making use of tools from from Hodge theory and the algebraic theory of differential operators. In the present project, the PI plans to extend this study in several directions. For example, he plans to generalize his previous work with Popa from the case of singularities of geometric objects defined by one equation to more general such singularities. In a different direction, he intends to investigate one interesting numerical invariant of singularities--the minimal exponent--and its connections  with other invariants and points of view on singularities. The PI will train graduate students in the area of research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI has been studying with Popa certain invariants of singularities, the Hodge ideals, for hypersurfaces and, more generally, for Q-divisors. These ideals  can be defined naturally in the context of Saito's theory of mixed Hodge modules. It turns out that the triviality of the Hodge ideals is governed by a numerical invariant,the minimal exponent, which is closely related to an important invariant in birational geometry, the log canonical threshold. While the minimal exponent has been studied a lot for isolated singularities, methods related to Hodge ideals allow treating the general case. There are two main components of the present project. In one direction, the PI intends to further investigate, with Popa, an extension of the theory of Hodge ideals beyond the case of hypersurfaces, by making use of the canonical filtration on local cohomology. There are several interesting questions in this context, concerning connections with the multi-variable version of the V-filtration and with the Bernstein-Sato polynomial for ideals. In a different direction, the PI plans to study general properties of the minimal exponent and its relations to other points of view on singularities (via divisorial valuations and resolution of singularities, or in connection to the motivic zeta function).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This calls for efficient and adaptive computing/communication co-design of wireless networks to optimize application-level latency (including both communication latency and computing times) and to achieve energy efficiency (considering energy consumed by both communications and computing).  This project develops fundamental theories and novel architectures of low-latency, energy-efficient, and computing-centric wireless networks to support emerging mobile intelligence applications. Theories and algorithms developed by the PIs are constantly integrated into the undergraduate and graduate courses taught at the two universities. This project also provides hand-on experiences to undergraduate and high school students with state-of-the-art wireless technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computing/communication co-design, while new for wireless networks, is a central topic in data center networks. However, the proposed solutions, while inspiring, are not directly applicable to wireless computing networks because of the unique features of wireless networks such as wireless interference, channel fading and limited energy. This project focuses on provably optimal mechanisms that dynamically and adaptively schedule computing tasks and data transmissions to meet application-level performance requirements, and consists of three interdependent thrusts: (i) Optimal computing/communication co-design. This thrust develops mathematical models and theoretical limits of wireless computing networks, (ii) Robust computing/communication co-design. This thrust focuses on robust computing and communication co-design that achieves desired performance with imperfect state information and under unavoidable short-term system overload and (iii) Learning-aided adaptive computing/communication co-design.

Project partners include Skyline Community College, Laney Community College, regional high school science teachers, and a nonprofit community partner, Bay Area Bioscience Education Community. The project will provide community college students with skills-based job training by involving them in preparation, quality testing, and packaging of low-cost biotechnology materials for use in high school biology courses. Examples of these materials include solutions and mixtures that are commonly used in processes such as DNA analysis in both biotechnology and biological research.  As they prepare these educational materials for use in high school classes, community college students learn industry bio-manufacturing procedures and quality control processes.  Production of these materials via community college biotechnology classrooms will result in savings that will be passed on, helping high school teachers to more readily provide biotechnology educational experiences in their high school science classrooms. Through these efforts, the project aims to make biotechnology science education materials more affordable to high schools and provide community college students with work-based learning experiences that prepare them for jobs as skilled biotechnicians. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on prior work that developed a successful plan to recruit high school students into community college biotechnology programs, this project aims to: 1) Expand and improve the pilot program by building upon past success and lessons learned; 2) Create stronger linkages and educational pathways between high schools and community colleges; 3) Provide professional development for faculty and collaborate with high schools to co-develop a new high school biotechnology curriculum; and 4) Scale the project regionally, engage industry in partnerships, and incorporate long-term sustainability measures. If successful, the project will provide a workable and scalable template for sustainable technician education that incorporates best practices across multiple sectors and institutions.  In providing pathways to careers in biotechnology, the project has included approaches intended to ensure that all students have equitable access to participate.  An important feature of the project is its plan to expand into introductory high school science courses that are required for all students.  Such an expansion will enable them to reach all students, not just those who self-select into biotechnology electives.

2002307.xml,Collaborative Research: Dry-Wet Phase Inversion Pathway of Graphene Oxide (GO)-Based Mixed-Matrix Membranes for Mineral Ions Separation by Membrane Distillation,NSF,2020-08-01,2025-07-31,300043,"Increasing pollution and water scarcity have created the need to access and recover unconventional water sources. One such source is high-salinity produced water, which surfaces from underground during oil or gas production. Produced water has an excess concentration of minerals and does not meet the regulatory standards of acceptable quality for drinking water. However, by removing these undesirable constituents, the produced water can be reused for agricultural applications such as irrigation, livestock watering, and aquaculture. Therefore, identifying a process to desalinate produced water is of great societal importance. Reverse osmosis is a pressure-driven membrane process used to desalinate water containing relatively low mineral concentrations, such as groundwater. The mineral concentrations of produced water are sufficiently high that reverse osmosis is unsuitable for desalination. Membrane distillation is a promising alternative technology capable of separating minerals from high-salinity water due to its unique thermal-membrane characteristics. Graphene oxide-based membranes, with their efficient antifouling properties, are expected to enhance the membrane distillation process. Graphene oxide-based membranes are fabricated using a state-of-the-art method called phase inversion. Phase inversion produces these membranes by integrating graphene oxide directly into the polymeric materials. This project sets out to develop a detailed fundamental and mechanistic understanding of the role that graphene oxide plays in a novel dry-wet phase inversion synthesis to produce membranes for membrane distillation. This project will also combine research and education activities to train a new generation of experts in the versatile area of membrane technology, particularly as applied to water treatment.<br/><br/>Membrane technology for water desalination and treatment of produced water has the potential to fundamentally alter the way society views water reuse. Augmenting water treatment capacity will allow rural, arid, and isolated regions with limited access to water, to have portable and reliable membrane systems for treating water. Advancing promising membrane separation processes for desalination, such as membrane distillation, requires access to fundamental knowledge of functional materials and structure-property relationship to engineer effective membranes. Membrane distillation is an energy-efficient alternative to multi-stage flash and multi-effect distillation processes and can be configured to concentrate brines. However, application of membrane distillation at scale is limited by the lack of suitable membranes exhibiting high permeate flux, water recovery, and resistance to scaling. The goal of this project is to establish and understand the dry-wet phase inversion membrane development approach to overcome these limitations in utility for produced water purification. Graphene oxide is a versatile anti-fouling nanomaterial that will be used in the synthesis of mixed-matrix membranes with properties specific to application in membrane distillation. Three research objectives are defined to provide fundamental insights into the dry-wet phase inversion process. In the first objective, the investigators will establish the role of graphene oxide sheet pH on pore formation and hydrophobic properties and determine the mechanism of dispersion of graphene oxide. The second objective examines ion retention on dry-wet phase inversion graphene oxide-based membranes during membrane distillation. And the third objective focuses on characterizing of the chemical, thermal, and mechanical stability of the dry-wet phase inversion graphene oxide-based membranes. Together, this knowledge will form a foundation for advancing membrane distillation for high-salinity water purification.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, ammonia combustion suffers from two major issues which are preventing its practical application. One is that ammonia flame is very unstable and can easily get extinguished. The other issue is its high emission, which pollutes the environment. In this project, a collaborative team will investigate using plasma (electric discharge) to enhance ammonia combustion process and reduce emission at the same time. The plasma-ammonia combustion interaction has not been studied previously. This award will investigate the underlying physical and chemical processes using experimental and computational tools. The new insights gained from experimental data will be used to develop computational models that can be used in research related to renewable energy. In this project, undergraduate and graduate students will receive hands-on training in experimental and computational skills.

Significant opportunities exist at both University of Minnesota and Georgia Institute of Technology to engage underrepresented students and researchers.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand the physical and chemical processes to stabilize ammonia flames and reduce NOx emission simultaneously by non-equilibrium plasma. This project has two key hypotheses: (1) prompt ammonia oxidation/decomposition introduced by plasma enhances flame; (2) the production of NH and NH2 from plasma reduces NOx emission. Accordingly, the scope and objectives of this proposed research are: (i) investigation of fundamental ammonia plasma chemical kinetics to understand its prompt dissociation and oxidation induced by plasma at different values of reduced electric field (E/N). This will be achieved by conducting experiments in a flow reactor with speciation measurement and one-dimensional (1D) numerical simulations with detailed plasma and combustion chemical kinetics; (ii) investigation of interactions between plasma kinetics and flame dynamics (including lean blow-off and thermoacoustic combustion instability) by conducting experiments in a model gas turbine combustor using NH, NH2, NO and OH planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) and three-dimensional (3D) direct numerical simulations (DNS) with a simplified plasma model deduced from detailed 1D modeling.

The process starts with one form of nanoparticle and trades out one type of atom for another. This leaves the nanoparticle with the same size and shape it started with, but with additional chemical components. This useful, but not yet fully understood, process is called cation exchange. This project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, uncovers how one can change the outcome of cation exchange by altering the features of the starting nanoparticle. It is expected that this will affect how much the particle changes in chemistry and where the new components go. It will also change the way the particles absorb light. The insights into how cation exchange works gained through these experiments will allow control over chemistry and structure on the nanoscale. This will eventually make it possible to design and create complex nanodevices that have a broad range of applications that are important to society, particularly in sensing and solar energy conversion. In addition to the benefits that come from directly from the science, training in materials chemistry will be strengthened through undergraduate research and an innovative partnership between laboratories at a primarily undergraduate institution and at an R1 university. Research infrastructure in the Central Pennsylvania region will be supported and barriers to broad participation in chemistry and materials will be reduced.  <br/><br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>Starting with copper sulfide nanoparticles, designed nanoheterostructures are created through selective introduction of new components through cation exchange. Preliminary data show that iodine oxidation of roxbyite nanoparticles alters the propensity for cation exchange with cadmium and zinc ions as it simultaneously alters the localized surface plasmon resonance of copper sulfide particles. It is proposed that oxidation/reduction processes can be employed as tools to modulate chemical and spatial selectivity of partial cation exchange. This project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program within the Division of Materials Research, seeks to reveal structure-property relationships affected by the alteration of copper sulfide nanoparticles through redox processes and to utilize these relationships to design novel plasmonic nanoheterostructures. The project examines various means of oxidation and reduction and elucidates the effects on structure, Cu-ion vacancy concentration, plasmonic behavior, and propensity for cation exchange in copper sulfide nanoparticles. The fundamental insights uncovered by the proposed work will advance our ability to control chemistry and structure on the nanoscale. The particles investigated have the potential to act as catalysts, solar energy absorbers in PV or solar water evaporation, NIR absorbers in photothermal cancer treatment, or sensors. Training in materials chemistry will be strengthened through undergraduate research with close student-faculty interaction and an innovative partnership between laboratories at a primarily undergraduate institution and at an R1 university.

2002742.xml,Fundamental Study of Interaction of Ions Present in Water with Graphene Coatings for Energy Harvesting,NSF,2020-09-01,2024-08-31,317268,"This project will investigate an approach to energy harvesting based on the interaction of a fluid such as water with a graphene surface. Graphene is a highly flexible, two-dimensional sheet of carbon atoms and is ideally suited for the coating of large surfaces. This project aims to demonstrate that water flow over graphene surfaces can directly generate electricity. Graphene is ideally suited for this application, since it possesses high-mobility charge carriers that are ready to be coupled to moving ions present in the flowing fluid. Graphene is also flexible, minimally invasive (it is the thinnest material), chemically and mechanically stable, and environmentally benign. Moreover, its synthesis is scalable and macro-scale continuous graphene films can be produced by roll-to-roll deposition techniques. The proposed graphene coating offers unique possibilities for energy harvesting from hitherto untapped renewable sources such as rain, tidal action, waves, ocean currents, river water as well as water flow over boats, submarines, and bridges. Such graphene skins could enable harvesting of the ubiquitous, abundant and renewable mechanical energy of moving water directly to electrical energy. Unlike traditional schemes, the graphene coating directly converts the flow energy into electrical energy without the need for moving parts. Such graphene coatings could also replace conventional batteries (which are environmentally hazardous) in low-power, low-voltage and long service-life applications. Once scaled up, this concept offers a potentially transformative approach to energy harvesting, as compared with incremental advances in current technologies. The investigators will develop specially designed interactive learning modules (or virtual labs) which will be integrated into the curriculum. Outreach includes demonstrations to undergraduates as well as to high school students and teachers. The PIs aim is to popularize science and to attract under-represented groups to pursue careers in renewable energy technologies.        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will tackle the fundamental science and engineering challenges associated with developing graphene-based coatings for nano-fluidic power harvesting. The key science challenge involves understanding in-depth the mechanism(s) responsible for nano-fluidic power harvesting in graphene films. In particular, the project aims to develop a fundamental understanding of how ions present in a fluid such as water, interact and couple with graphene-coated as well as free-standing graphene surfaces. This will be addressed using carefully designed control experiments in conjunction with molecular dynamics and first principles density functional theory calculations.     The engineering challenge is equally important and involves scaling up the graphene size in a manner that retains the outstanding power density of the coating. This will be addressed by adapting newly developed roll-to-roll and template-directed chemical vapor deposition techniques to produce macroscale graphene films and foams. The graphene manufacturing process will be optimized to avoid physical interfaces (breaks) in the film as it is scaled up to macroscale dimensions and to tightly control thickness and structure-properties of the graphene. The coupling between experiments and theory, modeling and simulation work will build fundamental understanding of the underlying science and enable successful development, optimization and validation of the proposed technology.

Increased development and urbanization in fire-prone areas, coupled with evolving climate changes, have significantly increased the vulnerability of human communities and ecosystems to wildfires. Even with large expenditures for fire suppression efforts, annual economic losses, as well as loss of human life, due to wildfires remain high.  This award supports research efforts to reduce wildfire activity by developing cost-effective methods to reduce risk through fuel treatment.  Fuel treatment involves removing vegetation (i.e., fuel) from a landscape to reduce the potential and severity of large-scale fires.  Fuel treatment, which forms a first line of wildfire defense, may include any combination of controlled burning, grazing, and various types of mechanical thinning.  This award will contribute to better understanding of what types of fuel treatment options and associated decision-making strategies are more appropriate for particular fire-prone regions.

The optimization framework will involve formulating and solving non-linear mathematical programming models for fuel accumulation and reduction under resource constraints. To take into account the inherent uncertainties with respect to fire ignition, the approach employs robust optimization techniques.  The project will investigate analytical results that describe important structural properties of the models and will develop specialized numerical algorithms to solve realistically-sized instances of the problem. The algorithms will leverage and extend modern techniques at the intersection of robust and combinatorial optimization. The models will be calibrated and validated using historical data from the Texas A&amp;M Forest Service, a state agency charged with overseeing forest management in the state of Texas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Monitoring and modeling evaporation over water surfaces such as lakes and oceans remains challenging. Better quantification and modeling of water evaporation requires improved understanding of the physical processes across the water-atmosphere interface.

2000566.xml,Collaborative Research: Algebra Instruction at Community Colleges: Validating Measures of Quality Instruction,NSF,2020-09-15,2025-08-31,124492,"This STEM Learning and Learning Environments project seeks to advance understanding of algebra education at community colleges.  It will build on prior work to explore further the relationship between the quality of instruction in college algebra classes and teachers’ mathematical knowledge for teaching.  This “knowledge for teaching” is the mathematical understanding that teachers need in order to be effective teachers of mathematics.  For example, this knowledge enables teachers to explore and diagnose why students are struggling with a mathematical concept and provide targeted help.  Despite its critical role in US higher education, instruction at community colleges is a neglected sector of instructional capacity in the United States. To advance mathematics education research related to the first two years of college, this project will develop the Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching Community College Algebra assessment.  This assessment will identify the specialized knowledge that teachers need for teaching community college algebra in a way that supports student growth in thinking about fundamental mathematical concepts. The project will also advance previous work by refining the Evaluating the Quality of Instruction of Post-secondary Mathematics instrument, which assesses characteristics of high-quality instruction in community college algebra courses.  These efforts will enhance the research tools available for studying post-secondary teaching at community colleges, specifically in College Algebra.  Since college algebra is often a gateway course to STEM degrees, this project has the potential to improve the recruitment into and success of students in STEM fields and, thus, support STEM workforce development. <br/><br/>The project involves four primary institutions: University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, Maricopa Community College District, and Oregon State University.  The primary goals of the proposed research are to: (1) develop, pilot, field test, validate, and disseminate the Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching Community College Algebra assessment; (2) refine items in the Evaluating the Quality of Instruction of Post-secondary Mathematics video-coding instrument to address aspects of instruction that support diversity, equity, and inclusion in mathematics classrooms; and (3) theoretically  and empirically explore the connection between the constructs that underlie both instruments. The project will use a mixed methods design that involves qualitative analysis of artifacts, item development, and psychometric testing, with the input of community college faculty in all the phases of the study, including integrating community college faculty as research associates, and thus building capacity for future research collaborations.  At the conclusion of this project, two instruments will be available to support multiple efforts to advance the quality of instruction in postsecondary settings and the professional development of instructors.  This project is supported by the EHR Core Research program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A measurement campaign will be conducted at Oliktok Point Alaska, a field site that is operated by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (DOE ARM) and is located in the vicinity of the north slope of Alaska oilfields. Atmospheric Cl emitted from wintertime saline snowpacks can react with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from the oil fields to form secondary organic aerosol (SOA). The importance of this process will be evaluated and the results may have application to other coastal, snow-covered, polluted locations around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will test the hypothesis that chlorine chemistry occurring in the vicinity of wintertime oil fields with saline snowpacks can result in the oxidation of VOCs emitted from oil field activities and the formation of oxidized VOCs (OVOCs) and SOA. The field deployment includes online mass spectrometry measurements of atmospheric VOCs, OVOCs, and SOA, and field-based oxidation flow reactor (OFR) experiments to investigate in situ Cl oxidation of VOCs and the resulting production of OVOCs and SOA.  These measurements will provide detailed datasets of molecular composition transformations initiated by Cl oxidation in the polluted wintertime environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project was supported under the NSF Grants for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) program because the U.S. Department of Energy has announced that the Oliktok Point field site will be closing in 2021, with the removal of complementary atmospheric measurements starting in the fall of 2020. There are no plans to reopen this site; thus, there is an urgent need to conduct the research at this site before it is closed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001025.xml,Sleep and Selective Emotional Memory Consolidation from Young Adulthood through Middle Age,NSF,2020-09-01,2025-08-31,899876,"People spend nearly one-third of their lives sleeping, and growing evidence suggests that one purpose of sleep is to strengthen memories formed during the day, particularly if these memories are emotionally salient. However, the majority of this evidence stems from data on college-age research participants that are not representative of the broader population. Little is known about sleep and memory function in middle age. This research will examine how sleep contributes to selectivity effects in memory in middle-aged people. One example of memory selectivity is the tendency to remember emotional information extremely well, often at the expense of neutral information. This research builds on prior findings, of the role of sleep in selective consolidation of emotional memories in young adults. This project combines EEG, fMRI, and behavioral approaches to examine how different phases and features of sleep can re-wire neural circuits used to retrieve emotional memories; how such re-wiring may be influenced by the way an emotional event is first experienced; and whether such processes differ as a function of age. The research will provide educational and training opportunities at two universities, and will promote healthy aging through regional and national outreach.<br/><br/>Sleep promotes memory for emotional components of complex scenes while conferring no benefit to memory for neutral, contextual elements. Moreover, sleep preferentially consolidates information that attracts overt attention and provokes a physiological arousal response during encoding. During retrieval, these effects of sleep-based consolidation are reflected in enhanced activity and connectivity within limbic circuitry. This project investigates whether sleep continues to aide in the selective consolidation of emotional information in adults over the age of 35. If so, do correlations between emotion, brain connectivity, sleep, and memory stay stable with age? If age disrupts selective consolidation, what changes in sleep architecture and/or encoding-related processing are most predictive of that disruption, and at what age do those changes begin to occur? This project further characterizes downstream consequences of sleep-dependent memory consolidation by examining neural circuitry involved during retrieval, fMRI will reveal whether age influences the sleep-related enhancement in limbic activity and connectivity during memory retrieval. This research will develop a foundational, basic-science understanding of sleep and emotional memory consolidation in middle age, and will inform development of sleep-based interventions to improve mnemonic and affective function as adults age.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Bosch group estimates that more than half of all cars first registered in 2017 came with at least one advanced driver assistance system (ADAS).  Examples include rear collision warnings, parking assist, emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, blind spot monitoring, and lane keeping assist.  The deployment of ADAS in vehicles is expected to continue to grow over the next 10 years. This project aims to produce workforce-ready ADAS technicians for the automotive industry by adding instruction on ADAS systems and diagnosis to the College’s automotive technology associate degree program and developing an ADAS technician certificate. This project, backed by industry and academia, will be designed to educate graduates who are skilled in ADAS methodologies and, thus, fill a gap in the modern automotive workforce.  As a result, it will contribute to the national need for a highly capable advanced technological workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project intends to improve student learning in science and engineering technician education by: 1) developing up-to-date ADAS-intelligent vehicle course content; 2) implementing an ADAS technical certificate program tied to a relevant industry credential that was developed in partnership with national automotive credentialing organizations; 3) acquiring autonomous vehicle simulation and ADAS lab training equipment; and 4) obtaining hands-on ADAS vehicle diagnostic trainers and autonomous vehicle mini-labs.  These curricular improvements and new equipment will enable students to learn fundamentals of ADAS systems and diagnosis including sensor technology such as Light Imaging, Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), wireless systems, radar units, ultrasonic transmitters, and steering angle sensors, as well as to use the same equipment that they will use in industry settings, including ADAS camera alignment fixtures with scan tools.   Project impact and success will be evaluated through performance-based techniques, using a mixed methods quasi-experimental design to analyze qualitative and quantitative data about project components.  This information will be used for ongoing project improvement.

2001688.xml,Professional development for K-12 science teachers in linguistically diverse classrooms,NSF,2019-08-01,2025-04-30,680255,"This project will engage science teachers in a sustained professional development (PD) program embedded in an afterschool science program designed for a linguistically diverse group of English learners (ELs). The project targets science teachers (chemistry, physics, biology, and earth science) who teach in a high school that includes refugees from Myanmar, Central America, and Africa. Roughly 20% of the students are classified as ELs, representing almost 20 different linguistic groups, including a variety of Asian, Spanish, and Arabic languages. The fundamental issue that the project seeks to address is the design of science learning environments to facilitate ELs' learning in linguistically diverse high school classrooms. Research on science education for ELs has recommended several effective teaching approaches, such as building on students' diverse and rich resources, engaging students in authentic science learning practices, and encouraging and valuing flexible use of multiple languages. However, previously most research has focused on teaching speakers of Spanish in elementary and middle school level science classrooms in which a majority of ELs speak the same language. Furthermore, while many PD programs supporting science education for ELs provide a short-term workshop and/or newly designed curriculum and curriculum guide, there is a lack of PD models that engage teachers in a sustained community of practice through collaboration between researchers and teachers. <br/><br/>The project's primary goal includes broadening participation with direct impact on 14 science teachers, who will impact over 2000 students, including over 450 ELs, during the project implementation period. The project provides a sustained model of the PD program which further impacts EL students of teachers who participated in the various phases of the project. The project has a potential to make an impact on ELs and high school science teachers of ELs in three different ways. First, by generating PD materials that include effective teaching materials and instructional practices for ELs, which can be used by other educators situated in similar educational contexts. Second, by giving presentations and publish papers that communicate findings of the project to academic communities. These outputs can impact other researchers who would like to design PD programs to foster ELs' science learning. Third, by implementing the developed and tested PD program in a larger scale. The implementation of the project will build capacity to conduct a larger PD project to impact more teachers and students. These anticipated outputs and outcomes will provide valuable resources for researcher and practitioners looking to support ELs' science learning and steps forward to equity. Finally, the project team and two cohorts of science teachers will co-design a school-wide science teacher PD to transform science teaching materials and practices of non-participating teachers.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs).

This shortage is estimated to affect more than 70 percent of energy employers across the nation. Northeast Wisconsin Technical College, a two-year technical college, offers one of the widest varieties of utility-related associate degrees, technical diplomas, and certificates in the Midwest. However, filling the workforce pipeline will require the coordinated efforts of many institutions, organizations, businesses, and other stakeholders.

2001261.xml,Doctoral Dissertation Research: The Effects of Wildfire Damage on Housing Access and Migration,NSF,2020-05-01,2022-04-30,15808,"Scholars and policy-makers have predicted that large-scale changes to migration patterns will significantly impact human communities. While migration scholarship has proliferated in attempt to better understand these dynamics, the field has overlooked one of the major factors reshaping landscapes: wildfires. The first aim of this project is to describe how wildfires affect migration patterns in the United States. The second aim is to examine the role of the built environment in mediating whether and how wildfire damage impacts migration patterns. It is well-established that housing access plays a crucial role in determining disaster recovery; initial damage to homes influences whether or not a household is displaced, and reconstruction or the availability of alternative housing is a major factor that affects longer-term return migration. Greater attention to the built environment can therefore improve scholars’ understanding of not just whether fires may influence migration, but how they may do so. The core topics investigated by this research – disaster displacement and post-disaster housing access - are immediately relevant to policymakers working in emergency management settings and to municipal and state officials working in regions at high fire risk, thus providing important input into policy and preparedness in these jurisdictions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study utilizes mixed-methods to examine questions of disaster preparedness from wildfires at multiple scales, and will involve three primary components. First, difference-in-difference econometric and network approaches will be used to analyze the relationships between fire damage and mobility patterns at a national scale. Data sources include the Internal Revenue Service’s County-to-County Migration Data, Arizona State University’s Spatial Hazards Events and Losses Database for the United States, and the U.S. National Incident Management System. Second, qualitative fieldwork in Butte County, California - including 50 semi-structured interviews and participant observation - will be used to illustrate from the ground-level how individuals and families navigated post-disaster housing access in the aftermath of the 2018 Camp Fire. This fieldwork will further examine what factors facilitated and what factors prevented return migration and post-fire reconstruction. Third, geospatial analysis of satellite imagery will be used to describe and quantify post-fire building reconstruction rates, which will in turn be compared between four major fire sites. Data sources include Microsoft’s U.S. Building Footprint Data, the multi-agency Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity database, and remote sensing images from DigitalGlobe. This research will contribute to a growing body of sociological theory on threats to the built environment by blending social and environmental data, incorporating spatial methods, and drawing from literatures on migration and urban environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They were pulled up with nets, scooped up from seabeds with grabs, and hand-collected by divers, all contributing to a library of biodiversity that captures the state of life in the ocean - year after year, decade after decade. The broadest evolutionary scope of those collections is in the marine invertebrates, animals without backbones - sea stars, corals, worms, jellyfish, crabs, and thousands of other animals. That library of preserved marine invertebrates is our essential guide to the diversity of ocean life across the globe. And because they encapsulate data from the moment they were picked up, these institutional collections also act as a time machine, letting us use the past to understand how our present will become the future. But there is a problem - vast numbers of these specimens are essentially invisible outside of a tiny community of museum specialists. The only record of these specimens' existence is on labels enclosed in the jars with the preserved animals or in paper logbooks on a shelf. These specimens will remain nearly undiscoverable on museum shelves until their core descriptive information is made digitally available. Therefore, this project will create public digital records for over 7.5 million specimens from our nation's legacy of marine exploration, thereby making the immense investment in the specimens' acquisition available to 21st Century biodiversity and ecosystems research. Because these specimens provide a visible and tangible window into our oceans' enchanting biodiversity, this project will involve STEM educators and student educators in the digitization effort, so that they will be able to reflect their science experiences directly back to the classroom. The public will be involved virtually, by contributing transcription of specimen label data. <br/><br/>Digitization of alcohol-preserved marine specimens has never been carried out on this scale. A major challenge lies in the location of the data: written, typed, or printed on labels in the jars with the specimens. In many cases, that will require opening the jar, extracting the label, and either transcribing it directly or photographing it for later transcription - for hundreds of thousands of jars. The immediate participants in this program will digitize most or all of the marine invertebrate collections at nineteen institutions across the country, more than doubling the number of digital records for marine invertebrates in the U.S. All data will be publicly available through existing data portals, including iDigBio.org, using standardized data formats, thereby dramatically enhancing the accessibility of biodiversity data for comprehensive, systems-based analysis of ocean ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conversion efficiency of a material requires that it have good electrical conductivity like a metal and low thermal conductivity like an insulator.  The primary challenge is decoupling these interrelated properties, a task that a type of compound known as Zintl phases are well suited for.  These compounds' unique and complex structures provide materials where thermal conductivity is low and therefore it is possible to focus on tuning the electrical transport properties. This project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program within the Division of Materials Research, is focused on the synthesis of new Zintl phase compounds containing transition metals and rare earth elements.  This project identifies new and existing crystal structures with proposed low thermal conductivity and provides a road map for enhancing the electronic properties for efficient energy conversion. This research impacts technology for our future energy needs and specifically the utilization of waste heat conversion into electricity. Next generation scientists receive fundamental training in materials synthesis and development of structure-property correlations. Undergraduate and graduate students are provided hands-on training and their scientific and communication skills are developed through workshops and individualized mentoring.  Undergraduate laboratory and classroom curriculum development is also incorporated in the project. <br/> <br/> <br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/> <br/>This proposal is focused on synthesis of new thermoelectric materials described as Zintl phases and development of structure-property correlations toward efficient energy conversion technologies. Thermoelectricity is based on three important transport parameters: the Seebeck coefficient, electrical resistivity, and thermal conductivity. The efficiency of thermoelectric materials is described by the unitless figure of merit zT, which is dependent upon all three of these interdependent properties. Zintl phases are considered a subgroup of intermetallics where metal cations and anions or polyanions form complex structures and are semiconductors. The foundational idea of Zintl to employ electron counting to understand complex solid state structure provides insight into bonding and allows for systematic optimization of properties. Therefore, Zintl phases are prime candidates for thermoelectric applications as they are semiconductors with large tunability because they contain both ionic and covalent bonding. Solid solutions of iso- and alio-valent elements provide a means to change carrier concentration and therefore the electronic structure to tune properties. Within this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program within the Division of Materials Research, specific structure types that are expected to have low thermal conductivity are targeted and the application of Zintl counting rules is tested in order to tune the electronic properties. Goals include both further optimization of Zintl structures and the synthesis of new compounds with structures that are predicted to give rise to low thermal conductivity and efficient thermoelectric energy conversion. The project focuses on mixed cations and light element containing phases that have not yet been investigated. New compounds are synthesized as single crystals and high purity powders via flux and metallurgical routes and fully dense pellets will be prepared via spark plasma sintering. Students and next generation scientists are provided hands-on training and their scientific and communication skills are developed through workshops and individualized mentoring.  The research will be presented at national and international meetings and the findings published in peer-review journals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The key properties of a useful invariant are that it is computable and that it distinguishes many different objects. It is challenging to determine such invariants for dynamical systems, an important class of mathematical structure. This project studies invariants of dynamical systems using the abstract concepts of operator algebras, in particular C*-algebras. The project will involve significant contributions from early-career researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students, who will benefit from training through research involvement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, given a dynamical system one can (often) construct a C*-algebra using a groupoid construction. The K-theory of this C*- algebra is an invariant of the original dynamical system. An important question is to determine the distinguishing power and computability of this invariant at the dynamical system level. The investigator will study the range of the Elliott invariant, which consists of K-theory and tracial information, for C*-algebras constructed from minimal and hyperbolic dynamical systems. The investigator and collaborators will systematically construct minimal dynamical systems with prescribed K-theory and will compute the K-theory of specific examples of C*-algebras associated to hyperbolic dynamical systems called Smale spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The multi-millennial tree-ring chronology will be used to extend reconstructions of spring and summer temperatures and build new records of winter storminess by analyzing traumatic resin ducts in annual tree rings. The winter storminess reconstruction is related to the strength of the Aleutian Low-pressure system (AL) and its analysis has the potential to transform the understanding of cold season ocean-atmospheric variability in the North Pacific. Specific goals of this project are to: 1) Generate 2,000-year-long records of wintertime AL along with summer temperature variability to determine how they responded to past climate forcing. 2) Use dendrochronology to precisely date when seven land-terminating and two tidewater glaciers advanced and retreated during the last 4000. 3) Test the hypothesis that the most extensive Holocene glacier advances in south coastal Alaska occurred when cooler summer air temperatures (reduced melt) coincided with a strengthened AL (increased snowfall). <br/><br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts include the collection of time-sensitive archives of buried wood that would be available to the scientific communities for multi-disciplinary investigations. The project will generate new reconstructions of spring-summer temperature, winter storminess and glacier advance/retreats to better understand the dynamics of climate-glacier mass balance and the North Pacific decadal variability at millennial time scales. This project will provide training for four undergraduate students as part of their undergraduate thesis including field work, data analysis and presentation of the results. The researchers will engage in public outreach by giving two talks at Glacier Bay National Park. In addition, a dendrochronology workshop in partnership with the Hoonah Indian Association and the Hoonah Native Forest Partnership will be organized in the Native Alaskan Village of Hoonah with the goal of engaging students in skill-based technique centered on the collection and analysis of tree-ring records.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001255.xml,EAGER: Collaborative Research: Bayesian Reasoning Machine on a Magneto-Tunneling Junction Network,NSF,2020-08-01,2022-07-31,119999,"Bayesian networks are a computational model that is very efficient for computing in the presence of uncertainty. It excels in such tasks as predicting stock market behavior, disease progression, etc. It is ideal for taking an event that occurred and predicting the likelihood of different known causes to have been the contributing factor. For example, given the symptoms of a patient, it can compute the probabilities of various diseases that could be causing the symptoms. Unfortunately, implementing Bayesian networks usually requires complex hardware that is expensive, prone to failure, dissipates too much energy and consumes too much area on a computer chip. The goal of this research is to overcome these disadvantages by replacing traditional electronic hardware with magnetic devices that interact with each other in a special way to elicit Bayesian inference. This can reduce the hardware complexity and all associated costs dramatically, making Bayesian networks compact and efficient. This research will establish the viability of this approach through extensive simulations. Graduate students will be trained in this field to produce a pool of skilled scientists and engineers with cutting-edge knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bayesian networks for computing in the presence of uncertainty leverage Bayesian inference engines implemented with complex hardware that often involves microcontrollers, shift registers, analog-to-digital converters, logic gates, etc. that dissipate exorbitant amounts of energy and have enormous footprints on a chip. It ha recently been shown by the project team that magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) that interact with each other by means of dipole coupling can implement Bayesian networks with vastly reduced energy cost and much smaller footprints.  Two dipole coupled MTJs A and B can realize an extremely efficient 2-node Bayesian network, where the probabilities of high and low resistance states of MTJ A are set by current or voltage, while the (random) resistance state of MTJ B is determined by varying degrees of dipole coupling between the two MTJs. The degree of dipole coupling is tuned with local strain applied to the soft layer of MTJ B using electrical excitation. This allows one to generate any desired anti-correlation or correlation between the resistance states of the two MTJs that can be varied between 0% and 100% using electrical excitation. In turn, this allows the generation of programmable conditional probabilities that can be exploited for Bayesian networks. This research will build a simulation base for this approach, test the viability of MTJ-based inference engines under different scenarios and design optimal sub-systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the conference at Wesleyan is to bring together a variety of researchers and students whose work connects to the study of group actions in dynamics to discuss the latest research findings and to seek collaborations to attack open problems in this area. <br/><br/>Homogeneous dynamics has proven to be a powerful tool in the study of number theory and geometry. Although in many cases qualitative results already suffice for applications, there are situations in which it is essential to obtain effective, quantitative results in homogenous dynamics. It usually involves giving estimates on the rates or error terms which concern various aspects of group actions on spaces. The conference will discuss recent progress on effective equi-distribution and shrinking targets in homogeneous dynamics, and study how these results could help advance the understanding of problems in number theory. Another main topic of the conference is the behavior of dynamical systems modeling a ball bouncing around inside a polygon. This research subject has found exciting connections and applications to algebraic geometry, rigidity theory in geometry, Teichmuller theory, and other areas of mathematics. The conference will host talks on recent works in this direction and discuss their applications to the geometry of tiling, translation surfaces, interval exchange transformations, and related topics. The conference will also include research talks in probability theory and random walks on groups, geometry of nilpotent groups, marked length spectrum, and rigidity of surfaces. It will provide a great opportunity for graduate students to be exposed to different perspectives of the modern theory of dynamical systems and to communicate with conference participants.

2002554.xml,SHF: Small: MIGS -- Efficiently Evaluating Multiple Iterative Graph Queries,NSF,2020-10-01,2025-09-30,500000,"Since graphs can readily represent entities and relationships among them, they are widely used to represent large volumes of data from domains ranging from social networks to biological and brain networks. Mining of large graphs for developing insights from data often takes the form of evaluating iterative graph analytics queries that originate at different points in the graph and compute global property values that are potentially dependent upon the structure of the entire graph. Such algorithms are both compute- and data-intensive; optimizing them is a challenge due to the large size and highly irregular structure of real-world graphs. While many systems for evaluating iterative graph queries have been developed, their focus is on minimizing the execution time of a single query though in practice many queries need to be evaluated. The goal of this research is to dramatically improve evaluation times of a group of queries by synergistically evaluating them to exploit the observation that evaluating individual queries involves graph traversals and computations that greatly overlap with each other. This research helps discover novel techniques for identifying and exploiting such overlap to reduce redundant costs and overheads associated with parallel executions on single-machine and multiple-machine platforms. Building such powerful systems accelerates new discoveries in fields that employ graph analytics. In addition, broader impact also results from training students in an area of national need.<br/><br/>Specifically, this research develops both system level optimizations and algorithmic innovations that work together to greatly increase the scalability of simultaneously evaluating multiple iterative queries. To guarantee versatility of techniques produced, the new optimizations and algorithms are being realized both in the context of a shared-memory multicore machine as well as a distributed cluster of multiple machines. Versatility is also achieved by supporting different kinds of queries (point-to-point and point-to-all) and different forms of graphs (fixed graphs and streaming or dynamic graphs). Each query type and graph type pose unique challenges to developing algorithms that are both correct and achieve high-performance. To exploit the overlap of work performed during evaluation of different queries, reuse-based algorithms are being developed while to update the results of queries in response to changes in the graph, incremental algorithms are being devised. These approaches are aimed at enabling high-performance and high system utilization on a shared-memory machine. To further scale performance to large batches of queries, distributed algorithms are being developed to utilize the resources from multiple machines in a distributed cluster. The evaluations utilize large graph data sets from public repositories such as KONNECT and SNAP. The software developed is made available to other researchers over the course of this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002763.xml,IIBR Multidisciplinary: RUI: Cross Departmental Development of an Automated Species Identification System for the Phylum Tardigrada found on Birds.,NSF,2020-07-01,2024-12-31,273565,"Tardigrades, also known as water bears, comprise a microscopic aquatic animal Phylum famous for their ability to withstand extreme environmental conditions and rapid changes in their environment by undergoing cryptobiosis, a process that allows them to desiccate with their environment and survive exposure to temperatures of near absolute zero, 6,000 atmospheres of pressure, and high vacuums. Recently water bears have gained global media attention for their ability to survive exposure to outer space. While the underlying molecular biology and physiology of tardigrades produced exciting applications in organ transplants and insights into ultra-violet radiation on the skin, little is known about the global diversity and distribution of this group. Tardigrades are found all over the world, from the bottom of oceans to the tops of mountains, but little is known about which species is where and how it got there. The project aims to unfold tardigrade dispersion, distribution, and diversity.  An automated robotic system to sequester, preserve, label, and image specimen tardigrades on laboratory slides for permanent storage will be developed. These images are then used to develop and “train” artificial intelligence software to identify species. The potential discovery and description of new, rare, and common morphospecies will expand regional knowledge of phenotypic diversity. The development of a new regional alpha taxonomic voucher collection at a major museum will be accessible worldwide, an invaluable tool in species identification which will promote the inclusion of tardigrades in global environmental and biogeographical analyses. The prepared specimens and the automated system for preparation and identification of specimens, stored at the Bohart Museum at the University of California, Davis, will be available for students, researchers, and museums world-wide to access in the future. To this end, highly qualified students from diverse ethnic, gender, and ability backgrounds begin by working in the field under the mentorship of Baker faculty at the Baker University Wetlands to collect samples from the local forested habitats and their resident bird populations. <br/><br/>This is a three-year project to modernize two of the fundamental infrastructure processes necessary for research into the phenotypic biodiversity of Phylum Tardigrada by a collaboration among three STEM departments (Biology, Physics & Computer Science) at a small undergraduate school (Baker University) with support from the Bohart Museum (University of California, Davis). Baker University faculty supervise undergraduate workshops to identify the biodiversity of tardigrades recently discovered on birds by first automating the 100+ yr-old process used to make slides and images of specimens by designing and building a microscope slide preparation, labeling and imaging system intended to reduce time, labor and cost. Second, faculty and student researchers automate the phenotypic identification of specimens to species by developing image/pattern matching software using a new image reference library built with artificial intelligence for students, researchers and museums. The products of this research will yield papers, chapters, and articles written by the students and faculty PIs. The design and directions for use of these technologies will be published such that students, researchers, and teams at universities and museums can build their own systems. This project will demonstrate that collections management, tabletop robotics, artificial intelligence, and computer identification of specimens are some of the infrastructure arenas requiring modernization for rigorous scientific research into invertebrate phenotypic diversity and ecology. Finally, the results of this multi-dimensional ecological study into the lives of tardigrades on birds will spread light onto a dark area of the tree of life.

The unique ecology and geology of Mesoamerica has fostered the rapid evolution of multiple species adapted for a variety of habitats and life modes. Computed tomography (CT) scans of internal anatomy paired with high resolution photos of external traits will provide complimentary image datasets to create a novel resource for one of the world’s most hyperdiverse regions. Increased access to digital vouchers generated by oMeso will enable research spanning multiple disciplines, from evolutionary biology and ecology to biomechanics and conservation science. The project provides inclusive training opportunities for university students in curation, data dissemination, and cutting-edge museum technologies. Beyond its research value, the oMeso PEN aims to increase scientific literacy and public engagement around Mesoamerican herpetofaunal diversity through a year-long exhibit accompanied by a community lecture, K-12 programming, and open access lesson plans that incorporate project products.<br/><br/>oMeso will increase the taxonomic scope of the oVert TCN by adding 1100 species across 160 genera, additionally filling a phenotypic data gap in the digital biodiversity landscape pertaining to reptile and amphibian media. These data will broadly support analysis of the patterns and processes relating to evolution, adaptation, convergence, and comparative and functional morphology. Extensive regional sampling will drive investigations into ecomorphology along various environmental gradients, and targeting endemic species will uncover rare or cryptic phenotypes such as those belonging to narrowly distributed microhabitat specialists, endangered, threatened and extinct species, and miniaturized taxa found throughout Mesoamerica. oMeso will leverage existing oVert TCN workflows and digital infrastructure to optimize efficiency and standardize products. Roughly 10% of specimens will be prepared with contrast-enhancement to render soft tissue structures in scans. Resulting raw CT tomograms, 3D surface models, and photo-stacked images will be openly disseminated through MorphoSource and Arctos and integrate with iDigBio, linking project media to corresponding source specimen records and extended data products (e.g., genetic sequences, publications, symbionts). oMeso will bring together collaborators from the University of Colorado, the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Florida, along with specimen contributions from seven museum institutions to develop this comprehensive and globally accessible whole phenome resource.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

GalapaGateway is a Partnership to Existing Networks (PEN) award that compliments the Open Vertebrate Thematic Collections Network (oVert TCN). This PEN will produce and disseminate high resolution three-dimensional (3D) imagery of approximately 1300 vertebrate specimens of reptiles, birds, and mammals from the Galápagos Islands, thereby increasing accessibility to these historical specimens. Resulting 3D scans will be available free of charge on multiple platforms, including iDigBio, MorphoSource, SketchFab, and a dedicated CAS portal that links scans to specimen data, fieldnotes, and images. Physical 3D models of selected specimens, such as giant tortoises and Darwin’s finches, will be printed for use in education and public outreach at the CAS and at the Charles Darwin Foundation in the Galápagos Islands. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the oVert TCN aims to scan a single representative of each vertebrate genus, this PEN will image multiple specimens per species to capture within-species variation. Variation within species of Galapagos animals was central to Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and continues to serve as a textbook example for explaining these foundational concepts to students and the general public. Through a combination of computed tomography (CT) and structured light surface scanning, the GalapaGateway project will create morphological data and 3D models of multiple series of closely related taxa from across the Galápagos Archipelago, allowing for in-depth analysis of vertebrate morphology, variation, adaptation, and speciation. 3D surface scanning will be used on specimens too large for traditional CT-scanning machines. Producing these scans of iconic historical specimens from the Galápagos will facilitate a wide variety of academic inquiries, including research into morphology and allometry, development, taxonomy, and adaptive ecology and evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the spatial pattern of glacial-interglacial climate and environmental variability in the tropics underscores the need for longer and better constrained data sets from the region to fully understanding forcings and potential feedbacks. The tropics play a crucial role in global moisture balance and heat redistribution. Additionally, environmental change in continental systems is also generally greater in amplitude and more spatially heterogeneous than in marine environments, where many of the early records of tropical climate variability are located. Thus, terrestrial records from the tropics are particularly necessary to fully resolve regional variability of glacial-interglacial climate variability and for comparison to existing high latitude records. This project will contribute to an enhanced understanding of Neotropical paleoclimate over the last 400 thousand years, and will illuminate temperature, hydroclimate, and vegetation shifts for a key location in Central America, Lake Petén Itzá. The researchers will mentor students in scientific communication with the broader public, focusing on the societal relevance of paleoclimate research, and will develop a paleoclimate-based, data-integrated exercise that will be used for hands-on undergraduate classes. Additionally, the project team will develop an open-access article describing paleoclimate science in an online journal aims to inspire and educate the next generation of scientists, reaching a large global student audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lake Petén Itzá, Guatemala, lies in a region dominated by trade wind migration and is influenced by sea surface temperature changes in the subtropical Atlantic basin. It thus represents a key spatial node for understanding large-scale climate variability of the northern tropics of the Americas. The investigators will use existing, archived drill cores from Lake Petén Itzá to develop records of changing Neotropical temperature (using brGDGTs) and precipitation (using δD values of leaf waxes), and the response of terrestrial vegetation (using δ13C values of leaf waxes) to these changes, in order to examine climate and ecosystem evolution over the past 400 ka. The investigators will integrate findings from the organic geochemical sedimentary reconstructions with previously published and currently on-going sedimentological and palynological research from Petén Itzá. Proxy-model comparison work will also be completed using these integrated reconstructions and other regionally available records with water isotope-enabled GCM experiments.

One promising means of overcoming data overload is through the introduction of multimodal displays which distribute information across various sensory channels (including vision, audition, and touch).  In recent years, touch has received more attention as a means to offload the overburdened visual and auditory channels, but much remains to be discovered in this modality.  Tactons, or tactile icons/displays, are structured, abstract messages that can be used to communicate information in the absence of vision.  However, the effectiveness of tactons may be compromised if their design does not take into account that complex systems depend on the coordinated activities of a team.  The PI's goal in this project is to establish a research program that will explore adaptive collaborative tactons as a means to support situational awareness, that is the ability of a team to perceive and comprehend information from the environment and predict future events in real time.  Project outcomes will contribute to a deeper understanding of perception and attention between and across sensory channels for individuals and teams, and to how multimodal interfaces can support teamwork in data-rich domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will integrate three disparate topics within human factors: multimodal interfaces, situational awareness, and adaptive systems.   The PI will create methods to design tactons that take into account both context and the types of information needed by a team, by leveraging the multimodal aspects to develop quantitative and qualitative models and algorithms using physiological measures (in particular, eye tracking data).  These in turn will inform the functionality of adaptive tactons that support collaboration by adjusting the presentation of information in response to various sensed parameters and conditions."

Over the last four decades some regions have moved from dependence on extractive industries, such as ranching, farming, mining, or logging, to economies centered around natural amenities.  This transition is accompanied by population change, which can have widespread effects on socioeconomic, cultural, political, and environmental aspects of a community.  This research will investigate conditions under which amenity development fosters gentrification, the effects of amenity development and resulting population shifts on the distribution of opportunity and influence, and practices that lead communities down alternative paths.  Findings of this research will help communities identify opportunities and strategies to transition to an economy centered around amenity development while minimizing negative impacts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data for this project will be collected through interviews in three locations: a long-time amenity destination, a new amenity destination, and an emerging amenity destination.

The present digital revolution with the ubiquitous mobile technologies and the surge in social media usage raise serious security challenges. This project is designed to address such challenges. The research will strengthen  mobile device communication channels in order to secure conversations, ensure that data is protected from interception, and prevent cellular fraud from occurring. There are two prominent standards for mobile networks in the country, and they are the Global System for Mobile Communications and the Code Division Multiple Access. While the latter is widely used in the United States,  the former has become the de-facto standard for global networks with its subscribers surpassing five billion in 2017. It is estimated that this number will increase to 5.7 billion subscribers within the next decade. This rapid growth brings with it security concerns that are addressed in this project through the development and analyses of cost effective and efficient encryption algorithms. The results and findings of the research will be widely disseminated through print media, professional conferences, seminars, and workshops. The software that will be developed from this research project will be made publicly available. Undergraduate students from under-represented minority groups in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics will be exposed to research in information security.  Overall, the products from this research will have far reaching benefits to the society in areas of secure mobile communications, image encryption and the development of information security research at Fayetteville State University (a historically black college and one of the seventeen constituent institutions in the University of North Carolina System).<br/><br/>Encrypted data transmissions through mobile communication channels are potentially vulnerable to cryptographic attacks since malicious agents may steal confidential information by running algorithms that can break the security of the encrypted data. Secure transfer of data through the combination of encryption and decryption, known as cipher, is the general approach to solving this problem in mobile communications. Specifically, stream ciphers do not suffer from propagation errors compared to other ciphers, and they tend to have better software efficiency. This research is focused on the applications of mobile communications and image encryption for which stream ciphers are often the typical choice. The research will span many aspects of stream ciphers, particularly Linear Feedback Shift Registers-based stream ciphers and their relationships to binary primitive polynomials and matrix operations. The project will include development of comprehensive software libraries written in two prominent computer-programming languages; comparative complexity and security analysis of algorithms that are stream-based; application of Graphics Processing Unit clusters for cryptanalysis of algorithms based on Compute Unified Device Architecture programming; engagement of undergraduate students in authentic research; and building research capacity in information security at Fayetteville State University.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000577.xml,Investigating the Benefits of Using Worked Examples to Improve Mathematical Explanations for Students Who Struggle,NSF,2020-07-01,2024-06-30,1498511,"When students explain their solution approaches in mathematics, they are able to make linkages with prior knowledge, build new insights, and deepen their understanding of the mathematics they are learning. Students with mathematics difficulties (those performing below the 25th percentile) struggle to articulate their understanding of mathematical principles as they explain their solution approaches. Learning and understanding fractions in upper elementary school is especially challenging for students and often impedes learning for students as they advance in middle and high school mathematics. The purpose of the project is to improve mathematical explanations for students who struggle in mathematics, specifically with fractions. To accomplish this, the project will investigate the benefits of worked examples (i.e., already worked-out problems) as a mechanism to improve explanations for students who struggle. The project will develop worked example materials focused on fractions concepts for use with students with mathematics difficulties in Grade 5 and examine whether this approach to instruction enhances students’ mathematical explanations during intervention. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project consists of three phases: development work, two short-duration randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and a feasibility pilot study followed by a multi-site RCT. First, the team will develop various types of worked examples (correct vs. incorrect solutions; one vs. two solutions) that address critical fractions concepts and operations in Grade 5 standards. Researchers will then conduct two short-duration RCTs to determine which worked example types are most promising for developing explanations for students with mathematics difficulties. Finally, worked example materials will be further developed and embedded as an instructional component into a previously validated fractions intervention. Intervention lessons will be examined in a feasibility pilot, which will be followed by a multi-site RCT. Eighty eligible students will be randomly assigned to receive small-group fractions intervention with worked examples or business-as-usual control. Student data will include measures of fractions concepts and procedures and assessments of written and verbal explanations. Assessments of working memory and attention will also be included. Implementation data will be collected using fidelity of treatment instruments and the CLASS observation system. Data analysis procedures involve a two-level hierarchical model and will explicitly account for the nesting of students in small instructional groups in the treatment condition but not in the control condition. A moderator analysis will be conducted by adding the interaction of condition with prior fractions knowledge, working memory, and attention.

Recent reports, such as the “Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America” distributed by the US Department of Health and Human Services, have generated a renewed hope for the millions of people around the world affected by this disease. To achieve this goal, it is imperative to understand the most effective use of available resources in light of the new prophylaxis treatment and the continued improvements of the highly active anti-retroviral treatment, particularly in the case of non-compliance. A realistic mathematical model, including these two treatments, as well as disproportional effects on disparate subpopulations, is essential for effective resource utilization. The broader impacts of this proposal are far-reaching from a public health perspective, but will also serve as a platform to train primarily underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students at the interface of mathematics and medicine. This collaboration between researchers at Howard University, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and the National Institutes of Health will train students to work in a collaborative team environment focused on addressing a pressing scientific problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Realistic mathematical models can suggest best courses of intervention that can significantly reduce the number of HIV infections. The effect of the pre-exposure prophylaxis treatment (PrEP) will be included in a previously developed mathematical model of HIV. Previous models of imperfect vaccines have shown the potential for a backwards bifurcation that can dramatically affect the dynamics of the epidemic. As a result, the same intervention that brings a model without a vaccine to the disease-free equilibrium, could drive the dynamics of the model with PrEP to a stable endemic equilibrium. Transmission of HIV depends on the viral-load of the infected individual. Thus, realistic mathematical models must include the effect of non-steady highly active anti-retroviral treatment (HAART) through structured treatment interruptions, lack of adherence to drug regimen and drug resistance. Non-steady HAART treatment regimes and the subsequent two-way movement between virally suppressed and chronically infected will require using non-exponential treatment stages into the model, which will be fitted to publicly available Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) data from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Since public health data will be used in the mathematical model, parameter identifiability will be addressed structurally and practically. Several numerical tools for accessing structural identifiability of the model will be used. The profile likelihood method will be used to assess the practical identifiability of model parameters and to provide confidence intervals for parameter estimation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By demonstrating a commercially scalable technique for tuning solid-liquid interfacial transport properties and biomolecular sensitivity of surfaces with nanometer precision, the project addresses significant applied research needs in the field. This work is anticipated to lead to the development of a new nanoscale manufacturing paradigm for the rational engineering of solid-fluid interfaces that can be applied to a broad range of functional molecules and substrates. Additionally, it will explore possible means to control interfacial transport and biological interactions with functionalized and nanostructured materials.  Thus, these studies will provide considerable cross-cutting scientific and technological benefits, which will improve the overall quality of human life and health. Because the project will also establish a pilot collaborative nanoscience program including students from two primarily undergraduate institutions (Colorado Mesa University and Central Washington University), which serve large Hispanic, rural, first generation, and non-traditional student populations, with students and researchers at University of Notre Dame, this project will contribute to the diversity of the scientific workforce. Specifically, the integrated research and education design of the studies will aid in student engagement, retention, and success. Because of the COVID pandemic, the PIs at all three institutions are actively engaged in developing a plan for inter- and intra- institutional collaborative research during the pandemic, planning for increased laboratory safety and utilizing information technology solutions for communications to mitigate the disruptive effects of the pandemic on the project activities while assuring researcher safety. Lastly, through community outreach and education activities via Colorado Mesa University’s Eureka Science Museum and Maverick Innovation Center, the PIs will contribute to regional educational development and economic development through entrepreneurship.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Filling this demand for advanced manufacturing technicians is critical to support the success of the region's advanced manufacturing industry, as well as to support the region’s economic development goal. This project intends to address this need by increasing access of high school students to the college’s dual enrollment program in advanced manufacturing.  It will do so by developing and using augmented reality and simulated lab experiences at the high schools. In addition, a new employability skills curriculum will be developed and integrated into advanced manufacturing courses, to prepare students for success in the workplace.<br/><br/>The goals of this project are to: 1) provide greater access to academic pathways leading to an Associate Degree in Advanced Manufacturing; 2) help students learn the critical technical skills needed by manufacturers; and 3) help students learn employability skills that are needed to be hired, stay employed, and advance in a technical career. Access to an existing dual enrollment curriculum in advanced manufacturing will be expanded to more high schools in the region. Multimedia training exercises will be developed including simulations, augmented reality, and electronic training materials for off-site locations using advanced augmented reality headsets and software. The employability skills curriculum will include instruction in collaboration and teamwork, communication, critical and creative thinking, leadership, self-management, and social responsibility.

At the same time, the rapid growth of high-speed wireless network services presents an opportunity for future distributed learning involving a vast number of smart IoT devices. This project targets several technical challenges posed by the limited reliability of wireless connections and computational constraints of the edge nodes in distributed learning systems. Overcoming these challenges is vital to the plethora of computation, communication, and coordination tasks required by distributed machine learning at the network edge. Centered on developing innovative edge learning algorithms over wireless MAC channels under the constraints of computing, power, and bandwidth, this project can significantly impact wireless edge learning in a variety of IoT applications, ranging from transportation, safety, and agriculture, to energy efficiency, e-health, and smart infrastructure. The broader impact of this research will also come through many educational opportunities by providing opportunities in STEM to K-12, women, and underrepresented minority students.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project will develop an innovative network architecture for distributed learning over wireless multi-access channels. Specifically, the PIs will take a principled approach to develop an integrated wireless edge learning framework, using both gradient-based methods and also very recent advances in gradient-free, zero-order optimization, while taking into account the constraints in computing, power and bandwidth therein, in a holistic manner. The developed methods will be also extended to the setting of distributed online learning and reinforcement learning under wireless MAC. The PIs will focus on optimizing communication-efficient gradient sparsification based local updates that are communicated within the wireless network under bandwidth constraints; and each sender intelligently carries out transmission power allocation based on learning gradient and channel conditions. One important objective is to develop a novel learning-based framework for efficient wireless channel estimation and update to enable effective power control and learning. The project will devise edge learning algorithms that are robust against wireless channel uncertainty. The team of PIs shall comprehensively investigate the impact of the wireless bandwidth and power constraint on both the accuracy and convergence speed of edge learning algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the former three branches originate from quantum physics, the last one deals with applications of purely algebraic concepts to geometry. Representation theory concerns the study of symmetries of a vector space such as three-dimensional Euclidean space (more generally, an infinite dimensional space) with additional structures. These symmetries can be often thought of as algebraic structures such as groups, Lie algebras, or associative algebras. Two cases are of particular interest: (1) the case of sufficiently many pair-wise commuting symmetries, which is a primary subject of study in integrable systems, and (2) the case when the underlying vector spaces arise via generalized cohomology theories associated with geometric moduli spaces. This project aims at resolving several open questions pertaining to those cases through the study of shifted quantum groups; the first surprising connections of those novel algebras to Toda-like quantum (difference) integrable systems and quantized Coulomb branches were discovered in the recent work of the PI.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The major theme of the proposed research is the study of shifted quantum affine algebras and the corresponding new structures on the quantized Coulomb branches. The project is broken down into five parts, as follows. The first part will investigate integral forms of shifted quantum affine algebras. One objective is to show that they map surjectively onto quantized K-theoretic Coulomb branches and to describe explicitly the kernel of these maps using the shuffle approach. Another important structure to be constructed on such integral forms are coproduct homomorphisms: these will descend to the truncated counterparts, thus quantizing multiplications of the corresponding classical K-theoretic Coulomb branches. The second and the third parts of the project are aimed at the construction and study of monoidal categorification of the quantum cluster algebra structure on quantized K-theoretic Coulomb branches via shifted quantum affine algebras, and a construction of new vertex operator algebras via shifted affine Yangians of gl(n). The fourth part deals with a novel approach to Lax matrices via antidominantly shifted quantum groups. This will bring new insights into now relatively old subject of the inverse scattering method. At the same time, it will also emphasize an overlooked importance of antidominant shifts, leading to a new study of Bethe subalgebras of the quantized Coulomb branches. This work will also provide a systematic construction of Baxter Q-operators, implying functional and TQ-relations for them. The fifth part of the project aims to obtain Kazhdan-Lusztig type character formulas for finite-dimensional representations of DeConcini-Kac truncated shifted quantum affine algebras at roots of unity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002431.xml,Collaborative Research: How Robust Are Common-Era Sea-Level Reconstructions?,NSF,2020-06-01,2024-05-31,85764,"Sea-level rise is one of the most challenging aspects of climate change.  In order to be confident in predictions of future sea level estimates, it is important to clearly understand how and why sea level changed naturally in the past. This project will collect field data and perform computer modeling to improve our understanding of the main factors that control average sea level during the Common Era (past ~2,000 years). For example, changes in wind and ocean currents, water temperature, and the rebound of land surfaces caused by removing the weight of ice or sediments all contribute to changes in the record of sea level at any location.  This project will examine the origin and nature of uncertainties that enter into sea level reconstructions based on errors in estimating each of these factors in the past. The project will not only help scientists improve our understanding of the causes of sea level changes, but it also will help coastal planners by providing better models for projecting sea-level changes into the future. The project will also support three young scientists, deepening their field, laboratory, and modeling skills.<br/><br/>Understanding sea level during the Common Era is central to establishing the uniqueness of modern sea-level rise related to anthropogenic climate change, identifying links between sea level and natural climate variability, and training semi-empirical models of future sea-level rise. Past studies estimate global-mean sea level during the Common Era using proxy records. These estimates differ substantially in terms of global-mean sea-level variability during pre-industrial times. It remains to establish how sensitive these estimates are to various uncertainties, assumptions, and choices involved in producing global-mean sea-level time series from the raw data. A detailed study of the robustness and reproducibility of Common-Era sea-level reconstructions based on field, laboratory, and modeling analyses is proposed. Objectives include: (1) determine the reproducibility of high-resolution salt-marsh sea-level reconstructions; and (2) quantify the robustness of model estimates of Common-Era global-mean sea level. Outcomes will fill basic knowledge gaps, advancing understanding of the Common Era, and leading to better characterization of trends, patterns, and causes of pre- and post-industrial sea-level change. By documenting past spatiotemporal variability of sea level, evaluating associated rates of change during the Common Era, and identifying links to ocean circulation and climate, the project will contribute to achieving the goals and scientific objectives of the Paleo Perspectives on Climate Change (P2C2) program. Efforts will make progress towards the broader goals of sea-level research related to the sensitivity of ice sheets to climate change, the response of the solid Earth to redistribution of ice mass, and the assimilation of proxy records and instrumental observations within a coherent probabilistic framework.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Reflux occurs when a bolus of gastric contents flows in reverse from the stomach into the esophagus. Symptoms of reflux can include chronic cough, choking, difficulty breathing or swallowing, upper airway infections, and chest pain, but these symptoms can also be associated with other serious medical conditions. The proposed technology will aid clinicians in quickly assessing a patient’s symptoms to determine if reflux is the underlying cause. A noninvasive diagnostic modality for assessing reflux could save the healthcare system $10 billion annually, allow clinicians to provide improved care to their patients, and reduce the out-of-pocket costs to the 80 million Americans who are affected by reflux-related symptoms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed STTR Phase I project will advance a technology using pulse-echo ultrasound and proprietary algorithms in a new non-conventional way to create an acoustic signature that can detect and differentiate a bolus in the esophagus. The esophagus distends in response to a bolus of material, eliciting the esophageal layers to change with respect to one another. Those changes can be observed with ultrasound sensors placed externally on the skin. This project will develop and validate electronic hardware, software, and custom ultrasonic transducers. This data acquisition system will be used to collect pulse-echo ultrasound data in an approved clinical early feasibility study. Data will be collected from patients undergoing modified barium swallow studies. The ultrasound data will be synchronized with the video-fluoroscopic images allowing for the development of a classifier algorithm which can automatically detect when a bolus is present at the level of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000759.xml,The Role of Attentional Control in Early Mathematical Learning,NSF,2020-07-01,2025-06-30,2494494,"The project, led by a team of researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, aims to understand the relationship between attention and early mathematical development. Children’s first mathematical skills, like counting and number estimation, are typically measured using tasks that require children to sustain attention. In some cases their knowledge of mathematics is intrinsically linked to attentional processes. For example, in counting, children must learn to attend selectively to each object in a set and do so in sequence. They must then say a different word for each object that is selected. Despite the importance of attention in these early mathematical skills, the precise role that it plays in supporting or constraining early mathematical development is not understood. The research described in this proposal will involve tasks that measure attention in conjunction with mathematical skills for individual children between 2 and 8 years of age in order to clarify the role that attention plays in early mathematics. It will help point to whether difficulties in some mathematical skills may be traceable to differences in underlying attentional systems. The researchers will recruit both high and low SES (socioeconomic status) children in order to understand whether SES differences in mathematical cognition may be traceable to these systems, thereby providing a necessary first-step in developing cognitively-based interventions which may improve achievement in these groups. The project is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning. <br/><br/>Two of the most widely studied numerical skills, counting and approximate number estimation, depend on appropriately deploying attentional resources in order to arrive at a mental representation of quantity. However, many cognitive theories and experimental studies treat measurements of these abilities as reflecting purely numerical processes rather than being dependent on general cognitive resources like attention. This project aims to quantify and formally model the role that attention plays in counting and estimation, and to clarify the degree to which it accounts for individual differences in performance on mathematical tasks, thereby allowing further investigation of whether attentional limitations may constrain mathematical development across age and SES. This will have the potential to show, for example, how much of children’s protracted timeline in learning counting may be due to waiting for the underlying attentional system to develop. If successful, this work will further help suggest what kinds of interventions on non-numerical cognitive skills may have important implications for improving mathematical education or potentially STEM education more broadly. The researchers will also create an open dataset of eye-tracking trajectories as children engage in numerical tasks, create tools for analyzing eye-tracking data, and formalize accounts of how visual information processing may give rise to patterns observed in numerical cognition, like subitizing, Weber’s law, and numerical estimation biases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With regard to public safety, this means better water control designs for reducing the impact of flooding from smaller urban to larger regional scales as well as for improved spatial and temporal warnings of flooding in order to reduce damage and fatalities. With regard to productivity in rural areas, such information has the potential for reducing the impacts of soil erosion through the better design of field run-off and water storage. In more urban areas, productivity depends in part upon good wireless communication. However, the advent of 5G wireless networks will be more subject to signal loss due to rain, a loss that also depends upon the largely unknown spatial structure of rainfall particularly above the ground. All of these improvements, however, depend upon the proper translation of radar measurements and numerical model outputs to many different scales. This in turn requires that radar measurements above the ground as well as numerical model products be correctly transferred to what appears at the surface where people live. This, then, is a central objective of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically with regard to the science, this project allows a more complete description of rain structure in a multi-dimensional context including height with the additional benefit of developing a better multi-dimensional understanding of drop interactions and evolution. Furthermore, the project is directed toward a more comprehensive investigation into the prevalence and the importance of statistical homogeneity in all three spatial dimensions as well as in time. Statistical homogeneity is important for the proper scaling of rainfall measurements, but, of course, not all rain is statistically homogeneous. However, it often appears that when the data are statistically heterogeneous, such data may be subdivided into statistically homogeneous sections which can then be properly treated analytically. This project develops this approach. In addition, wind tower measurements as well as simultaneous measurements between two 2DVD disdrometers will be used to explore further the reported deviations of drop fall speeds from their nominal terminal values both aloft and at the surface. This is potentially quite important for the proper understanding of the evolution of rain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To achieve this, tiny vehicles called carriers are often needed, but unwanted interactions within the body often limit their effectiveness. This project uses knowledge of the molecular interactions between bacterial/viral pathogens and human cells during human infection to design bioinspired polymer coatings for drug carriers. The project will provide deeper insight into chemical structures that simultaneously limit biofouling on the carrier surface and enhance attachment of carriers to human cells. Longer term, these results will enable the development of nanocarriers that can provide better treatment of disease by decreasing the amount of drug required for treatment and limiting side effects. This project will have a direct impact on the educational experience of students at various levels. Two graduate students will perform research for their Ph.D. theses and several undergraduate students from underrepresented groups will participate in the research. Further, a K-12 outreach program in engineering and science will utilize concepts from the research during camps throughout the state of Iowa and provide graduate and undergraduate students with opportunities for teacher training. Research results and discoveries will be disseminated through publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at local, national, and international conferences.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/> <br/>Current drug delivery strategies to target specific cells within the body are plagued by low levels of drug accumulation in the areas they are most needed. When drug carriers enter the body and interact with biological fluids, biofouling of the carrier surface occurs and new surface properties develop that control the carrier’s subsequent bio-interactions and fate. Our lack of knowledge of how to design drug carriers with appropriate properties to trigger and mediate their interactions within complex biological environments has significantly hindered progress towards efficient drug delivery. The goal of this proposal is to design a surface coating for nanocarriers to simultaneously address issues of biofouling and cell uptake in complex biological environments. Bioinspired polymeric ligands containing molecular structures that mimic the surfaces of respiratory pathogens known to efficiently penetrate human fluids and the lung epithelium will be developed. The ability of ligand-coated nanoparticle to target lung epithelial cells submerged in natural secretions will be experimentally observed and quantified. Two independent techniques will be pursued to evaluate the molecular recognition of the ligands. First, a high-throughput, optical biosensor technique will quantify the real-time cellular responses to receptor-ligand interactions in living cells. Second, a 3-D homology modeling approach will elucidate the ability of the ligands to dock into the receptor binding pocket. Results from these studies will provide insight into chemical structures that mediate the binding and activation of receptor-mediated processes. Through biomolecular mimicry, the proposed studies will lead to more efficient design of ligands that will enhance nanocarrier delivery.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Biomaterials Program in the Division of Materials Research, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Polymers Program in the Division of Materials Research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Patterned materials are essential components in numerous societally-critical applications including electronics, communications, data storage, and sensing. However, current approaches to processing these structures result in patterns that are static and often limited in their functionality. This award supports fundamental research to provide the knowledge needed to realize new classes of patterned materials with properties that cannot be accessed through currently available processing approaches. This new manufacturing strategy combines industrially-relevant and scalable processes used to pattern materials with low-temperature chemical reactions to create oxide-based structures with tunable properties that can be reconfigured in response to external stimuli. The dynamic nature of these structures could serve as a platform for a new generation of adaptive devices. Therefore, the new manufacturing insights and approaches resulting from this project benefit the U.S. economy and society. The project provides research training to students on a variety of experimental skills sought by industry and engages local high school students in promoting engineering fields.<br/><br/>Topochemical transformations are solid-state chemical reactions that alter composition but retain central features of the material structure. When carried out on lithographically-defined areas, these reactions enable the creation of oxide-based lateral patterns with controlled geometries, diverse chemistries, and new functionality not afforded by existing processing routes. However, the ability to harness the full technological potential of this manufacturing strategy rests on developing a fundamental scientific understanding of numerous aspects of the process. This research addresses these knowledge gaps to better understand the relevant mechanisms and kinetic limitations. The research team identifies the relationships between material composition, crystal structure and processing parameters by systematically varying the reactions on different patterned metal oxides.  The team establishes the kinetic factors that set the ultimate limit on feature sizes in nanoscale patterns and enable the formation of non-binary structures and elucidate the stability and reconfigurability of the structures under applied electric fields and through sequential reaction steps. In doing so, the research enables manufacturing of lateral structures including functional oxide and oxyfluoride ABO3/ABO2F, e.g., SrFeO3/SrFeO2F patterns that facilitate applications such as reconfigurable or transient electronics, diffraction gratings, and sensors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Preserved specimens in museum research collections are a record of Earth’s biodiversity and provide a baseline for assessing past and future environmental changes, planetary health, and for understanding how biodiversity arose and proliferated. Major efforts over the last several decades have sought to make museum records digital to facilitate their access and inclusion in large-scale research projects. Computerized tomography (CT) scans are an increasingly common way to make digital specimens, especially when the insides of the specimen have also been preserved, as with whole fish preserved in jars. However, with birds, CT scans will miss the color and arrangement of feathers, features of great importance to researchers and also appreciated by the public. oBird will create 3D digital models using a process called photogrammetry. Photogrammetry uses hundreds of photographs from all angles of a specimen to create realistic, interactive 3D virtual models in full, natural color. The 3D models from oBird will be free to access on the internet, facilitating research on the origins of bird diversity, including novel colors and pigments. The 3D models will also be incorporated into public displays on biodiversity in the new Anderson Center for Environmental Sciences at Occidental College as well as lesson plans for K-12 education.<br/><br/>As a partner project to the Open Vertebrate Thematic Collections Network (OVert TCN), oBird will extend OVert into the world of 3D photogrammetry, an emerging method in collections digitization that preserves the external features of specimens as interactive, 3D models. The project will increase genus-level coverage of avian diversity compared to OVert from 60% to 90%. The 3D photogrammetry technique involves taking hundreds of 2D photos of a whole, dried bird specimen on a rotating stand followed by processing with a novel, automated computational pipeline that generates a 3D model with minimal manual oversight. oBird will prioritize imaging the same species as OVert to provide paired external and internal anatomy across species. The 3D models will be hosted on MorphoSource, an open-access platform for storing and archiving 3D data, extending access to large-scale phenomic data in furtherance of the OVert research theme: the evolution of vertebrate morphological diversity. By providing natural-color data for 3D specimens, oBird will thus bring more accurate and realistic color analysis to research on plumage evolution, especially in the comparative context of an existing bird tree of life. New questions that will be enabled include research into the origins and evolution of bird plumage color and morphological novelty in beak dimensions and wing shape, enabling comparative evolutionary study of these important ecomorphological traits. oBird will integrate with a strong undergraduate research program in a large bird natural history collection at a small liberal arts college, providing training in digital technology and effects, biodiversity informatics, and museum collections.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By non-invasive observations, it is meant that what is being measured is not the system reaction to actively injected inputs, but rather the system behavior when it is operating under standard conditions and subject to potentially unobservable forcing signals. The capability of designing controllers based only on non-invasive observations is of paramount importance for any large scale network fulfilling critical or uninterruptible functions (i.e., a power grid, a logistic system) or in situations where it is impractical or too expensive to inject known probing signals into the system (i.e., a gene network, a financial network). Other relevant applications are in medicine (i.e., repeated drug testing, computer- assisted anesthesia). Indeed, in these cases, for obvious safety and health concerns, it is not desirable to actively test the response of a patient to a different drug dosage or treatment, if comparably useful information could be inferred from non-invasive observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since non-invasive observations do not always provide full information about the network's configuration, the project will also consider how to define adequate control mechanisms that are robust with respect to uncertainties in the connectivity structure. These kinds of uncertainties are not typically considered in standard techniques for control design and the development of specific methodologies is required. Combined with the capability of adapting to changes in the network's configuration, these control techniques will provide a solid foundation for the realization of a self-healing system. This project will bridge together different areas, including statistics, computer science, and control theory with a single unifying framework. New courses will be created to facilitate communication among all these communities of researchers, advancing separate fields in a multidisciplinary way."

Along with this research, Richers will conduct astronomy outreach to high school and college students in Central America.<br/><br/>This research project will incorporate key physical processes, including neutrino transport, collisions, and flavor transformation, into existing large-scale computer codes used for modeling neutron star mergers.  The central thrust of the project is a rigorous treatment of the impact of neutrino flavor transformation on merger ejecta.  Including this critical missing process in models will permit a thorough interpretation of light curves from binary neutron star mergers, and allow a better understanding of heavy-element nucleosynthesis in such mergers.

2000330.xml,Excellence in Research: Biofilm Adhesive and Kinetic Properties Under Hydrodynamic Influences During Early Evolution Stages,NSF,2020-08-01,2025-07-31,712172,"Biofilms are aggregates of bacteria.  Biofilms play important roles in ecological, industrial, and biomedical processes of national relevance. For example, they are associated with biofouling, where microorganisms attach to surfaces and reduce the performance of machines. In medical fields, biofilms play a key role in the development of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. Biofilms often form in wet environments under fluid flow. Although a large body of knowledge on biofilm formation exists, little is known about how initial single- and multi-cell interactions and fluid flow influence the growth and final structure of biofilms. This project will analyze the fundamental processes that govern cell interactions within a biofilm in fluid flow environments. The results will improve understanding of the developmental stages of microbial biofilm formation by investigating the bacteria cell responses under flow conditions. This may ultimately lead to a way to control biofilm evolution.  These outcomes could also help with novel diagnosis and treatment methods for problems caused by biofilms. This project is a collaboration between researchers at two two Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and one national lab.  The institutions are Howard University, Florida A&M University, the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. The project supports the interdisciplinary training of underrepresented groups.  Undergraduate, graduate, and K-12 students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) will participate at their respective institutions.   <br/> <br/>Biofilms constitute an inherent part of the natural life cycle of most microorganisms, and most bacterial biofilms develop under hydrodynamic stress. The hypothesis is that the cost of growing and evolving in hydrodynamic conditions for these banks of bacteria has a net effect of initiating and promoting intrinsic physical, physiological, and kinetic properties that may contribute to biofilm resistance and resilience. This project presents a novel strategy to investigate the impact of hydrodynamics that occurs within bacterial communities using live and model bacteria systems and high-resolution fluorescent velocimetry. This research integrates theoretical and experimental work with the following objectives: (1) Investigate the various hydrodynamic conditions at the substratum boundary and their effect on the adhesion kinetics and spatial distribution of bacterial cells and (2) Determine the impact of hydrodynamic forces on the intercellular and interspecies interactions during biofilm evolution, and (3) Develop a working model for predicting the kinetics of recruitment and detachment of bacteria to and from biofilms under hydrodynamic milieus.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Refugee youth are sometimes overlooked by educators because of their emerging language skills, but like other youth they are capable of making important STEM contributions. This project recognizes and leverages the STEM knowledge and perspectives of Burundian refugee adults through a family-focused model that connects Burundian refugee families with university faculty and undergraduate students. Families with children ages 12-17 will participate in: “living room outreach events” facilitated by students and faculty, opportunities to meet and interact with STEM professionals, field trips to multiple university campuses to learn about college life and various STEM pathways, and informal STEM learning experiences of choice with other families. Additionally, older children will participate in an innovative technology experience that facilitates mentoring relationships between STEM professionals and the youth through an electronic-based STEM Aspiration journal shared between the mentee and mentor. At the core of the project are partnerships and opportunities for reciprocal learning, where parents are able to share their expertise while also learning more about how to be effective advocates for their children; youth are able to learn from undergraduate and practicing professional mentors, while undergraduates also learn from Burundian youth; and Burundian leaders teach faculty and undergraduates about Burundian history and culture while faculty and undergraduates share their experiences with navigating STEM career pathways. <br/><br/>The project advances knowledge of refugee families’ STEM experiences and aspirations through research framed around social cognitive career theory. The investigators examine the composite and specific effects of each of the project activities on the youth participants’ self-efficacy, STEM identity, outcome expectations, and STEM interests, in support of their STEM goals. Additionally, the researchers aim to understand how college social capital and STEM capital among Burundian refugee families both directly impacts and acts as a moderator on children's STEM aspirations. In this pilot study, the investigators take a mixed-methods research approach, where qualitative methods allow them to understand how different aspects of the program impact the youth participants. In collaboration with Burundian leaders, the researchers adapt survey instruments for cultural validity, and administer the surveys for additional data related to the impact of the program activities. Contributions from this project will include: a family-focused outreach model that can be used by other universities and/or with other refugee communities, an approach to facilitating remote mentoring through shared electronic journaling,  research findings related to how different aspects of the model impact refugee participants, and research instruments that have been adapted for use with refugee populations. The project will provide a foundation for possible future scale-up with other refugee populations (and in other communities), informed by the findings from this project and further supported by the International Rescue Committee. <br/><br/>This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts, and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Glycans mask pathogens and signature molecules from host cells and confound therapeutic treatments. N-glycans are the commonly found type of glycans found on cell surfaces.  Pathogens like Ebola, SARS, HIV, and COVID 19 are shielded by N-glycans having high mannose content, with the mannose content sometimes increasing during the host infection. The goal of the proposal is to investigate what biophysical properties of mannose residues present in shields of N-glycans confer protection of pathogens against the host immune system. This project will train graduate and undergraduate students and provide an annual hands-on STEM workshops to engage high school students in research and everyday science. Understanding how mannose residues presented in N-glycans protect pathogens will help us strategically disarm the glycan shield fortress, thereby making pathogens more vulnerable to detection, sanitizing, and treatment.  <br/><br/>Despite the ubiquitous presence of glycan sugars on biological surfaces, little is known currently about how glycans steer interfacial effects like aggregation, biofilm formation, charge shielding, antifouling, immune-stealth, and transport through mucus. This project will lead to a better understanding of the biophysics of mannose residues when presented in N-glycan architecture along with non-mannose sugars, and how they relate to the improved solubility and aggregation, mucous penetration, and immune evasion of glycosylated molecules. To understand the uniqueness of mannose biophysics and how it interplays with other N-glycan sugars, the cross- and self- interactions of all N-glycan sugars will be determined, and rules for integrating single-sugar biophysics to glycosylated system behavior will be evaluated. A pseudo-typed HIV virus is the controlled sugar-presentation platform. These studies will synergistically link observations from force-spectroscopy, rheology, and dynamic light scattering, along with perturbations from glycosidase and lectin addition.

Large uncertainties remain regarding the magnitude and direction of the projected precipitation response with ENSO.  Numerous lake sediment paleoclimate reconstructions have been developed from the Amazon, Andes, and Galapagos Archipelago with the goal of understanding the response of ENSO and tropical hydroclimate (i.e., precipitation amount, intensity, and seasonality) to past climate changes.  Disagreement between these records, however, complicates the ability to prepare for climate risks and hydroclimate extremes.<br/><br/>This project specifically aims to: (i) improve the interpretation of tropical lake sediment archives and facilitate proxy-model comparisons using high-resolution moisture tracking simulations with a comprehensive climate model; (ii) constrain the sensitivity of tropical paleo-climate records from the early-Holocene to present; and (iii) synthesize climate reconstructions from lakes with climate model simulations to understand tropical hydroclimate variability across spatial and temporal scales.<br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts include improved understanding of the magnitude, timing, and drivers of tropical hydroclimate variability over the Holocene.

Some climate models indicate that the vast tropical rain bands may shift south in response to such a perturbation, which has important implications for understanding how the climate might change in the future if a warming ocean disrupts ocean circulation. Yet few reconstructions of rainfall exist from the tropics that span the 8,2000-year-ago time interval, making it difficult to confirm the model-based predictions. To remedy this data gap this project will reconstruct rainfall changes in the tropical Pacific from chemical variations in lake sediments in Palau and the Galápagos that lie on the northern and southern edges of the modern tropical rain band. The research will include climate model simulations elucidating the rainfall changes expected in Palau and the Galápagos in response to a meltwater addition to the North Atlantic similar in size to that estimated during the 8,200-year-ago event. A workshop will be held for Micronesian high school teachers along with an experiential learning coarse in Kosrae (Micronesia). Students from the University of Washington will work with high school teachers and conduct field exercises and create curricular activities based on their experiences. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Rainfall will be reconstructed from hydrogen isotope ratios of the microalgal lipid dinosterol in radiocarbon-dated sediments from lakes in Palau and the Galápagos. Confidence in the regional nature of the hydrogen isotope signals will be achieved through replication of measurements, sediment cores, lakes, and islands. All nine sediment cores, which range in length from 2-15 m, have been collected, and most have initial radiocarbon chronologies. A temporal resolution of 25-40 yr is proposed for the 7,000-9,000-year-ago interval of each core, which ranges in thickness from 50-250 cm. The remainder of the Holocene period in each core will have hydrogen isotope data produced at 250-500-yr resolution in order to place any of the 8,200-yr-ago excursions in the context of the full Holocene. Interpretations of these rainfall reconstructions, including their global context, will be aided by simulations with the isotope-enabled Community Earth System Model forced with realistic meltwater fluxes to the Labrador Sea. Because models diverge widely in their response of tropical Pacific rainfall to freshwater forcing, our rainfall reconstructions will provide a critical benchmark for these models and help constrain the mechanisms by which the tropics respond to abrupt AMOC disruptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Biologists have long believed that interactions with predators, competitors, and helpful mutualists are a powerful force in the history of life, helping to spur the formation of new species. However, it is difficult to test whether interactions between living things have been more important than the effects of the physical environment like heat, freezing, or drought. This project makes that comparison by taking advantage of a unique interaction between species that live in the extreme environments of the Mojave Desert. Joshua trees, the spikey, twisted-looking trees found across the Mojave, cannot produce fruit without the help of yucca moths. Joshua tree flowers appear to be adapted to the moths, but the trees also experience extreme heat and drought, and it seems likely that these effects of the physical, nonliving environment also impact their survival. The Joshua Tree Genome Project will use genetic sequencing and experiments with Joshua tree seedlings to study how the trees cope with different climates in different parts of the desert. The project collaborators can then compare the effects of climate on Joshua tree populations to the effects of their interaction with yucca moths. The team will also engage volunteers and science teachers across the Mojave region to measure and monitor Joshua tree populations in their own backyards. By examining the Joshua tree's adaptation to climate in detail for the first time, this project will help to answer a longstanding question in the history of life on Earth — whether interactions between living things or the physical environment have been more important — and develop scientific tools and community partnerships that can help protect Joshua trees under changing future climates.<br/><br/>The Joshua Tree Genome Project is a collaboration of ecologists, geneticists, bioinformaticians, and plant physiologists at Willamette University, California State University Northridge, the Universities of Alabama and Hawaii, and the US Geological Survey Western Ecological Research Center. The collaborators will plant Joshua tree seedlings at common-garden sites around the Mojave, monitor their growth and physiological performance, and use RNA sequencing to identify genes that are differentially expressed in different climates. The team will complete a Joshua tree reference genome and use it with the gene expression results to design a sequence capture array for targeted sequencing of hundreds of trees. Targeted sequencing will allow them to perform genome-wide association study (GWAS) of physiological traits that contribute to seedlings’ survival and performance in the common gardens, and of floral traits related to pollination by yucca moths. The team will then use landscape genomic analyses to identify genes showing signatures of local adaptation to variation in climate and moth traits. Meanwhile, the team will expand a participatory science program working with Mojave-regional conservation nonprofits and K-12 educators to train volunteers to survey the demography of Joshua tree populations, recording how many trees flower and produce fruit, and how many young trees are present to renew the population. Finally, the team will use the results of their genetic analyses to build a genomic prediction protocol that can project the physiological and pollination-related traits of a Joshua tree population from genetic data alone. The team will use this protocol to predict the traits of trees at sites profiled by volunteer surveys, and test for relationships between populations’ predicted trait values and their demographic health. This will allow them to identify specific traits that influence the fitness of Joshua trees in current conditions, and would provide a tool to assess the resilience of Joshua tree populations in future climates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is expected that the award will (1) further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, (2) improve research and teaching at the home institution, and (3) engage more undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in research experiences. The project from Bowie State University, a Historically Black College/University (HBCU), seeks to study the structural requirements for allosteric binders to certain enzymatic proteins that maintain protein homeostasis in mammalian, yeast, and plant cells.  The project integrates computational chemistry and biology with analogous bench research.  In addition, it is designed to include undergraduate and high school students as active researchers. Collaboration and mentorship will take place throughout the project. The PI will collaborate with another researcher at Georgetown University, while the undergraduates will serve as mentors to the high school students under the supervision of the PI.  <br/><br/>VCP is an ATPase which plays a major role in the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS).  The UPS is responsible for degrading unfolded proteins through the proteasome in order to relieve cellular stress. Once tagged with ubiquitin, VCP translocates the proteins from the ER to the cytosol. VCP binders have been shown to cause an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins which ultimately leads to cell death. This is favorable when the system is being exploited to avoid apoptosis. Six-membered ring heterocycles have been shown to act as ATP-competitive binders and are therefore unselective.  Five-membered ring heterocycles bind to an allosteric site of VCP and are highly selective. However, it is unclear what the structural requirements for allosteric binders are. We propose the synthesis of imidazole compounds through a microwave-assisted multicomponent reaction in order to access a variety of imidazole compounds with numerous substitution patterns.  These compounds will be tested and ultimately help define the structural requirements for allosteric binding to VCP.  We will also measure the effect of these imidazoles on VCP activity and cell death.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2001089.xml,Logarithmic Geometry and the Gauged Linear Sigma Model,NSF,2020-08-01,2024-07-31,179999,"Algebraic varieties are a class of geometric objects obtained by gluing together sets of solutions of polynomial equations. In string theory, a branch of theoretical physics, algebraic varieties are used to describe fine pieces of our universe. In this theory, everything is made of tiny strings which travel through spacetime, and trace out algebraic curves in some algebraic varieties. Gromov-Witten invariants, originating from physics, are virtual counts of algebraic curves in algebraic varieties satisfying prescribed incidence constraints. They are used in physic to describe the structures of our universe. They also provide new approaches and insights to classical problems from algebraic geometry. Despite their importance, these invariants are very difficult to compute. The primary goal of this project is to develop a new method to calculate Gromov-Witten invariants by investigating the boundary of the gauged linear sigma model from physics using tools of logarithmic structures from algebraic geometry. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, this project focuses on studying the geometry of the gauged linear sigma model (GLSM) using stable log maps of Abramovich-Chen-Gross-Siebert. The GLSM proposed by Witten in the 1990s can be viewed as a deep generalization of the hyper-plane property of Gromov-Witten invariants in all genus. However, the moduli stacks in GLSM which carry the perfect obstruction theory for defining GLSM invariants are in general non-proper. This presents a major difficulty in calculating GLSM invariants. Recently, log compactifications of hybrid-type GLSM were constructed by Chen, Janda, and Ruan using stable log maps. These compactifications provide proper moduli stacks carrying a reduced perfect obstruction theory whose associated virtual cycles recover the GLSM virtual cycles. This project is an integrated study aiming at a new computational method for calculating Gromov-Witten invariants by investigating the structures of the virtual cycles of these log compactifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000127.xml,RAPID: Collaborative Research: Tracking Amazon Forest Fires from Source to Sink,NSF,2019-11-01,2021-10-31,63789,"Fire plays a key role in Earth's ecosystem dynamics with profound effects on biogeochemical processes, climate, and environmental quality beyond the significant threat to people and infrastructures. This year has seen the most forest fires in the Amazon Basin of Brazil since 2010, providing a compelling opportunity to study the impact of fires on carbon fluxes in the Amazon River system, and, together with an auspiciously-timed cruise planned to the Guyanas mudbanks in 2020, to characterize the corresponding signature of biomass burning along the entire continuum from source on land to sink in the oceans. This project takes advantage of this opportunity through time series sampling of the dissolved and particulate load in the headwaters and the lower reaches of the Amazon River. This effort will be combined with targeted sampling campaigns across the full river depth profile at high and low discharge to capture the export of material to the Atlantic Ocean. Pyrogenic carbon concentration and composition will be measured by combining specific molecular work (anhydrous sugar levoglucosan and benzene polycarboxylic acids, or BPCAs) with ramped pyrolysis oxidation to characterize the chemical continuum that makes up pyrogenic carbon. Radiocarbon content and stable carbon isotope composition will help to distinguish pyrogenic carbon derived from combustion of living biomass (as opposed to that eroded from soils or old sediments, for example). Compared to a baseline established during a period of time when fire activity in the Amazon basin was relatively low, river samples from 2019 offer a chance to test whether pyrogenic carbon fluxes to the ocean respond to an increase in fire activity. The offshore samples will allow for characterizing how this pyrogenic carbon is transformed and/or preserved in the coastal ocean. Rapid-response funding will be essential to capitalizing on the unique combination of existing baseline data, the pronounced increase in fire activity this year, and the planned 2020 cruise. The outcome of this project will lay the groundwork for future efforts at reconstructing past fire activity, e.g., in association with upcoming drilling projects in the Amazon system supported by International Continental Scientific Drilling Program and the International Ocean Drilling Program.

The importance of understanding the reasons for this condition at a fundamental level is very significant, since this condition that can sometimes result in deaths.<br/><br/>The goal of the proposed research is to advance the fundamental knowledge of biological fluid dynamics in prediction and control of human snoring through a combined physiology-based modeling, physics-based simulation, analysis, verification, and optimization approach. This approach is also applicable to a wide range of engineering and biological systems, such as noise reduction and phonation. There are mainly two objectives: (1) to develop a methodology for unveiling the flow physics and sound-producing mechanism of biological fluid-structure coupling problems and (2) to use the methodology for the investigation of optimal intervention procedures in order to ease the vortex-induced snore symptoms towards a better quality of life. The proposed work is highly interdisciplinary and involves fundamental scientific problems in the fields of biology, physics, physiology, and engineering. Snoring is an audible sign coded with richness of information about human respiratory functions. The sound comes from a complex interaction between compliant airway structures and the transient vortex shedding which is induced by the narrowing of the airway passage. However, the specific snore source mechanisms are still elusive, despite the significant in vitro and clinical efforts. Physics-based numerical investigation of the snore source will promise to quantify the relationship between the nonlinear response of the flexible airways and the respiratory vortex dynamics for sound generation. Currently, snore source diagnosis relies on expensive and time-consuming procedures that are outsourced to special analytical laboratories. Such challenges in performing in vivo and in vitro snore diagnosis will make the numerical methods ideal investigative tools. The PIs propose to systematically study the snore-producing mechanisms of different age and gender groups, paying particular attention to the underlying physics of biological fluid-structure interaction and associated sound sources. This is to be accomplished through the use of a combined modeling, simulation, analysis, validation, and optimization approach. The findings from the proposed research could provide pre-surgical guidelines for alleviating the apnea-causing factors by minimizing sound production of the system. Findings from this work could be used by acoustic experts and respiratory therapists for understanding the sound source production and control from its biological origin. The theories developed from this research will promote accurate diagnosis of snore sources and effective treatment of patients with snoring or other respiratory disorders. The research work will also be the central theme in a multi-level education program in which: (1) PIs will continue to provide summer undergraduate research experience to attract and retain engineering students from under-represented groups; (2) the proposed methodology will be incorporated into the PIs' existing graduate level course on bio-inspired flow and respiratory aerosol dynamics; and (3) an educational lab curriculum in snore specialty will be developed to provide multi-disciplinary training and research opportunities for high-school and college students and to support biomedical and bio-inspired engineering programs in both University of Virginia and Central Michigan University"

2002364.xml,"Collaborative Research: Response of the Tropical Pacific to the Abrupt Climate Change Event 8,200 Years Ago",NSF,2020-10-01,2024-09-30,456415,"A catastrophic outburst of glacial meltwater into the Labrador Sea 8,200 years ago disrupted Atlantic Ocean circulation, plunging the North Atlantic region into cold conditions for more than a century and impacting climate globally. Some climate models indicate that the vast tropical rain bands may shift south in response to such a perturbation, which has important implications for understanding how the climate might change in the future if a warming ocean disrupts ocean circulation. Yet few reconstructions of rainfall exist from the tropics that span the 8,2000-year-ago time interval, making it difficult to confirm the model-based predictions. To remedy this data gap this project will reconstruct rainfall changes in the tropical Pacific from chemical variations in lake sediments in Palau and the Galápagos that lie on the northern and southern edges of the modern tropical rain band. The research will include climate model simulations elucidating the rainfall changes expected in Palau and the Galápagos in response to a meltwater addition to the North Atlantic similar in size to that estimated during the 8,200-year-ago event. A workshop will be held for Micronesian high school teachers along with an experiential learning coarse in Kosrae (Micronesia). Students from the University of Washington will work with high school teachers and conduct field exercises and create curricular activities based on their experiences. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Rainfall will be reconstructed from hydrogen isotope ratios of the microalgal lipid dinosterol in radiocarbon-dated sediments from lakes in Palau and the Galápagos. Confidence in the regional nature of the hydrogen isotope signals will be achieved through replication of measurements, sediment cores, lakes, and islands. All nine sediment cores, which range in length from 2-15 m, have been collected, and most have initial radiocarbon chronologies. A temporal resolution of 25-40 yr is proposed for the 7,000-9,000-year-ago interval of each core, which ranges in thickness from 50-250 cm. The remainder of the Holocene period in each core will have hydrogen isotope data produced at 250-500-yr resolution in order to place any of the 8,200-yr-ago excursions in the context of the full Holocene. Interpretations of these rainfall reconstructions, including their global context, will be aided by simulations with the isotope-enabled Community Earth System Model forced with realistic meltwater fluxes to the Labrador Sea. Because models diverge widely in their response of tropical Pacific rainfall to freshwater forcing, our rainfall reconstructions will provide a critical benchmark for these models and help constrain the mechanisms by which the tropics respond to abrupt AMOC disruptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000994.xml,Calibration and Analysis of Mount Wilson Magnetograms and Dopplergrams for the Years 1967 to 2013,NSF,2020-04-01,2024-03-31,295947,"The Sun influences the Earth and its environment in a large range of phenomena, such as aircraft radiation levels, atmospheric drag on spacecraft, long-distance power transmission, pipeline charging and radio communication (especially at high latitudes), etc.  Severe solar storms can disrupt global communications and damage spacecraft.  These effects have been detailed in ""Committee on the Societal and Economic Impacts of Severe Space Weather Events: A Workshop, National Research Council (2008),"" and are further discussed in ""Committee on a Decadal Strategy for Solar and Space Physics (Heliophysics): National Research Council (2013).""  The most recent solar cycle 24 was of relatively low strength, and the upcoming cycle 25 is beginning slowly.  Cosmic ray records, as recovered by proxy indicators, suggest that the solar cycle goes through long periods of strength and weakness lasting one or more centuries, which are called grand maxima and grand minima.  In the past few decades, there has been considerable progress in understanding the mechanisms governing the Sun's magnetic cycle.  In this process, comparisons between model output, including predicted cycle variability and the observed characteristics of the solar cycle, is an essential step in the validation of the models.  This 3-year research project is aimed at increasing the number of available solar cycles from four to five by carrying out a new calibration process of the unique magnetogram data gathered by the Mount Wilson Observatory (MWO), thus improving their quality for further use by the broader solar-heliospheric community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MWO, under the direction of G.E. Hale and H.W. Babcock, pioneered in the discovery and measurement of solar surface magnetic fields.  From 1964 to 1985, under the direction of R.F. Howard, the visible solar disk magnetic fields were measured and digitally recorded on magnetic tape.  The PI of this project, R.K. Ulrich, managed the program from 1986 to 2013.  The full digital record spans 46 years, or about four solar cycles.  For the years 1967 to 1973, a major part of solar cycle 20, no other set of regular magnetic field measurements is available.  In April 1973 a program of daily magnetogram observations was started at the Kitt Peak National Observatory, and in May 1975 daily observations began at the Stanford Solar Observatory, now the Wilcox Solar Observatory (WSO), with data from space-based systems becoming available in 1995.  All these data series, except that from the MWO, continue today.  During this 3-year project, the PI will carry out a new calibration of the MWO magnetogram and Dopplergram series, which will take into account various changes in the instrument hardware, calibration data acquisition methods and software reduction methods.  Initial analysis of the magnetograms from 1967-1969 shows that there are significant irregularities in the nominal calibration process.  Also, all the magnetogram measurements depend on complex spectral line formation processes so that the derived fields are different for each of the series referenced above and, within each series, across jumps due to instrument and calibration changes. The resulting dataset of magnetograms consistently calibrated over an extended period of time is important for cross-calibrating (and identifying systematics in) the magnetic field measurements taken with other instruments during the same period of time.  The use of solar surface magnetograms is required for the calculation and prediction of conditions in the heliosphere.  An ""Open Magnetic Field Flux Problem"" has been noted in several studies, so that the calibration and interpretation of the magnetogram observations has become a central issue.  This project will address this issue following up on the work carried out previously by the project team.  The data products from various stages of the recalibration, including the final, best result will be retained and made available to the community and public through partnership with the Stanford Helioseismology Archive which is part of the JSOC system at Stanford University.  The project team will work with the broader solar community to incorporate the MWO magnetograms into the ADAPT/WSA pipeline, which yields predicted properties of the solar wind.

From affiliation with social movements through the use of Twitter hashtags, to collective organizing through Facebook, social computing tools have catalyzed new and exciting forms of civic engagement (efforts taken by individuals and collectives to address issues of societal concern). While historically it has been challenging to engage youth in civic action, social computing platforms offer a media-relevant way for youth to address issues that matter to them. However, despite increased opportunities for civic engagement online, youth can have difficulty navigating their social networks, which creates challenges for understanding and putting to use the social capital within networks, that is, the beneficial resources that can support collective action. This research examines how interactive visualizations of youth's social networks can help youth more effectively understand and put to use the social capital within their networks. Such visualizations may support civic engagement by easing access to the rich and complex information about social ties, helping youth evaluate the impact they have through online civic action, preparing them to make effective decisions about future activities.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The work will include the design, development, and evaluation of two novel smartphone applications. Although there is a large literature on how best to visualize these networks from an algorithmic perspective, very little is known about how people, especially young people, interpret network visualizations, nor whether or when network visualizations may enhance access to and utilization of social capital. This project will contribute new empirical findings and novel software tools to fill this research gap. Additionally, although complex network data is increasingly packaged for public consumption, there are few standards for how to do so effectively, particularly in the context of mobile visualizations where small screen real estate dramatically amplifies the visualization challenge. The research will contribute new knowledge regarding how best to visualize network data for lay audiences, on the mobile platforms that people are increasingly using to interact with data. This work will yield empirical assessments of how designed interfaces can best manage the complexities of networked data in order to amplify cognition, action, and feelings of empowerment. This work will culminate in a conceptual framework to guide the design of social computing tools for youth civic engagement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ESB region is densely populated, with 47% of the U.S. population expected to inhabit the counties adjacent to the shoreline by 2021. Habitat loss, pollution, overfishing, and climate change threaten commercially and ecologically important marine species all along the ESB. This project will make occurrence data with map coordinates available for over 3,000 species of mollusks that find their habitat along the ESB, including mussels, clams, conchs, snails, and squid. Data from these ecologically and commercially important species (over 4.5 million individual specimens) will be made available through public online data portals. While the geographic ranges for many species of mollusks are well-known, the extent of their distribution within the seafloor habitats they occupy is unknown. Adding map coordinates to occurrence records for live-collected mollusks in natural history collections will provide detailed knowledge of distributions. Because natural history collections have specimens collected from the mid-1800s to present, these occurrence records can help track distributional changes over time and lead to better fisheries and conservation management.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One hundred million mollusk specimens have been documented in natural history collections across North America, and the breadth, depth, and growth of these collections is exceptionally well-known compared to other invertebrate taxa. Mollusks are among the best sampled group of animals, with some species having over 2,000 digital records available in natural history collections making them extremely well-suited for environmental and biogeographical studies that track faunal change over time and space. However, already-digitized mollusk lots are missing essential data such as collecting date (30% of records) and reliable georeferences (85% of records). This project will generate reliable geo-coordinate data for all covered specimen lots using a collaborative georeferencing project in GeoLocate.  GeoLocate will add layers for bathymetric data, benthic habitat, and marine conservation areas. Incorporating bathymetry into GeoLocate to determine the extent of locations will also provide that capability for complex elevational data for terrestrial species. Important trait data will also be incorporated. For the first time, molluscan occurrence data will distinguish between live- and dead-collected specimens, with a defined vocabulary for traits added to each record. Due to the long persistence of molluscan shells, the live/dead- collected distinction is crucial for all studies of biotic change using mollusks. Information on collecting dates will be refined where possible to increase resolution for detecting biotic changes. The data will be shared through public data repositories, including iDigBio, GBIF, OBIS, and the InvertEBase Symbiota portal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This state contains specific new modes on intersections of different surfaces of the crystal. These so-called ""hinge"" or ""corner"" modes have the potential to form the basis of future topological quantum computers, immune to errors and able to perform calculations currently unthinkable. An exciting example of such materials is FeTeSe, where the PI provided the first evidence that it is a higher order topological superconductor. Using expertise in fabrication, electrical, and optical spectroscopy, the PI will develop new means to probe the properties of the hinge modes in FeTeSe systematically. The topics and techniques also provide an excellent starting point for creating public talks and recruiting a diverse set of trainees, undergraduate and graduate students, who also participate in public outreach. The project's participants gain valuable professional skills in: collaboration, computation, fabrication, and characterization. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Higher order topological phases have recently emerged, with boundary modes in two or more dimensions smaller than the bulk. These are systems whose boundary states are themselves topological, gapped with different signs. Using his expertise in fabrication, electrical, and optical spectroscopy, the PI will develop new means to probe the properties of the hinge modes in FeTeSe. An array of contact configurations and protocols will determine the best method to isolate the hinge from the bulk. This effort is aided by photothermal measurements to image the hinges. Careful studies of the effects of magnetic fields and magnetic contacts will determine the details of spin momentum locking. The studies will reveal the transport, thermal, and spin-momentum locking of the hinge modes. As such, their robustness will be directly probed, along with determining the proper ground-state Hamiltonian to describe the hinges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many published palynological studies done in the Tampa Bay area and the southern parts of Florida. However, there are no published materials on the Northeast area of the state.  A Burkard volumetric sampler will be used to trap airborne pollen grains. The sampler will be on the roof of Edward Waters College. This area is in the poorest, most urban, and predominantly African American area of Jacksonville and is known as Health Zone 1 by public health officials. Another sampler will be place on the roof of a building in the wealthiest Health Zones (Health Zone 6) to compare pollen grain concentrations. Pollen concentration will be determined after transferring samples onto microscope slides for staining with Caberla’s solution and then identification and quantification using the single longitudinal traverse method.  This seminal aeropalynological study will allow characterization of the local vegetation in Northeast Florida. Undergraduates will gain an appreciation of Forensic palynology in which they can use this ideal biomarker for associating people and objects to specific places. Undergraduate students will experience how meteorological conditions can influence the pollen season. Global warming and climate change will affect the pollen patterns and will affect the most vulnerable population such as residents of Health Zone 1. Long-term pollen monitoring through this volumetric method would generate data to establish a phenological pollen calendar for Northeast Florida. The determination of the pollen content in the air and the data analysis will enable the characterization of pollen types with a view to correlating the results with pollen allergy data from the Department of Health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because natural history collections are permanent repositories for past and present parasite specimens, these collections and their data can help address these significant societal challenges in human and animal health and safety. Natural history collections often contain specimens and ancillary materials that are completely unknown to the broader community, yet represent irreplaceable knowledge about organismal habitats, distributions, and parasite-host associations. Further, these collections yield information that can be used to model ecological processes and changes in species distributions, predict the future spread of human and animal disease, update taxonomy, and help identify under-represented parasite groups in urgent need of sampling and threatened parasite diversity in need of conservation.

The underlying assumption of the project is that individual attributes such as self-efficacy and career values, as well as environmental factors such as organizational climate of the STEM workplace, could explain job transitions and persistence of early- and mid-career STEM doctorate holders. The project will contribute to knowledge about how these individual attributes and perceptions of environmental factors might change with various socialization, acculturation, and professionalization processes during and after the STEM doctoral education is completed.

2002465.xml,Collaborative Research: Reconstructing river discharge and hydrologic variability in Panama via coral geochemistry: Implications for management of the Panama Canal,NSF,2020-06-01,2024-05-31,94235,"Rivers and hydrology play a critical role in tropical ecosystems. They impact aspects of climate, help to sustain life, and influence societal needs such as drinking water, food security, and economics. In Panamá, a specific concern is the impact of rainfall on the functioning of the Panamá Canal. Rainfall and river discharge (Q) are strongly linked in Panamá, and they play a crucial role in the sustained success of the canal. Rainfall totals across Panamá consistently place it in the top five countries for annual rainfall, but when major droughts occur, the Panama Canal Authority places restrictions on ship traffic to conserve water so that the canal can continue to operate. Panamá has a well-known seasonal variability in precipitation, with a wet season that lasts from about May through November. However, little is known about rainfall variation on longer time scales, on the order of decades or centuries. In addition, it is not clear how El Niño events may influence Panamanian rainfall, though there are suggestions of a relationship between El Niño strength and drought severity. These questions are hard to address because instrumental data, particularly river discharge records, are short and often unreliable – we need a longer-term perspective. The chemistry of coral skeletons can preserve records of climate conditions and climate variability; these chemical records are called climate proxies. This project will use coral climate proxies to reconstruct hydrologic variability along the Pacific Coast of Panamá over the past ~300 years at near-monthly resolution. The final product will be a multi-coral, multi-proxy record that can be used to identify the frequency and strength of events such as droughts or El Niño. This project includes support for 8 female undergraduates and 1 Ph.D. student. Results from this project will be incorporated into a teaching workshop for middle and high school educators and will also be shared with water resource managers in Panamá. <br/><br/>Many tropical nations are subjected to intense variation in precipitation with extreme seasonality. Meridional migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is largely responsible for this variability, with northward movement during the boreal summer and a southward shift during the austral summer. In the Pacific, El Niño and other less well constrained decadal and century-scale modes of ocean- atmosphere variability also dictate regional climate. In Panamá, a country whose rainfall and river discharge (Q) are tightly coupled, understanding hydrologic variability is of the utmost importance when considering the potential impacts on the Panamá Canal, whose functioning relies solely on hydraulic head differences between the canal locks and the Gatun Lake reservoir. Therefore, the probability of anomalous hydrologic conditions, such as drought and flooding, must be well defined. However, the lack of long instrumental records of tropical hydrology (i.e.; rainfall and Q) limits our ability to develop a rigorous understanding of drought and flood recurrence intervals. These issues raise the following questions: 1) What is the relationship between El Niño Southern Oscillation and droughts and flooding in Panamá? 2) Can we identify droughts and flood years that are not related to El Niño? And 4) Has there been multi-decadal or long-term secular changes in Q in Panamá and what climatic processes are involved? Preliminary results indicate that barium/calcium (Ba/Ca) time-series data from a coral core collected in 1984 at Secas Island in the Gulf of Chiriquí (GoC) along the Pacific Coast of Panamá has a remarkably strong correlation with Q from two major nearby rivers. Given these encouraging results, we will be completing the Ba/Ca analyses of the Secas Island core back to 1707 CE and to analyze a new GoC coral core collected in 2018. The final near- monthly resolved composite Ba/Ca record of Q will extend from 2018 to 1707 CE. By pairing Ba/Ca and δ18O on the same 1mm samples we can separately evaluate salinity and sea surface temperature changes in the GoC over the last 311 years. These paleo-Q and salinity reconstructions will provide a comprehensive history of Panamanian hydroclimate that can be exploited to track protracted deviations from average conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001815.xml,Doctoral Dissertation Research: Community Partisanship: Analyzing the Local Processes that Produce National Politics,NSF,2020-05-01,2022-04-30,15999,"How do the communities where people live shape the way they understand national politics? Although the concepts of red and blue states are familiar to most Americans, we have little understanding of how that patchwork emerges from the everyday processes and interactions of the people who live within it. To understand how local contexts produce the geography of American politics, this project follows three communities through the 2020 presidential campaign. These communities are similar socioeconomically, but have historically voted very differently. The three towns are similar blue-collar, Midwestern towns located in predominately rural counties, and yet they vote for opposing parties in presidential elections: one is staunchly Democratic, another is devoutly Republican, and a third has a voting history that is more mixed. What is it about these communities that influences similar people to vote differently? Findings from the project will be of interest to all political actors who have an interest in understanding and predicting voting patterns in presidential elections, as well as those interested in constructing effective political campaigns.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To understand why demographically similar small towns vote differently in presidential campaigns, this project uses both qualitative and quantitative methods. Relying on Census and voting records from 1932-2016, a hierarchical clustering algorithm was used to identify the three cases based on their demographic similarities and their different voting histories from 1964-2016. The qualitative portion of the study will draw on three different types of data: in-depth interviews conducted with 90 voters across the three towns at four different points during the 2020 U.S. presidential election; in-depth interviews with 75 community leaders from churches, non-profits, unions, political parties, and local government; and ethnographic observation of key community organizations’ mobilization efforts during the campaign. All qualitative data will be analyzed using the RQDA qualitative analysis package.   Data from the interviews and observation will demonstrate how the meso-level of organizations and community life shape voters’ understandings of national politics. In answering this question, this study advances the scholarship on partisanship and polarization in American politics by re-orienting its focus away from individuals’ demographics and toward the place-based processes of sense-making that help people understand the complex political world.  Findings from the project will inform sociological theories of political identity and political participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000454.xml,Developing an E-book and Other Interactive Instructional Materials for Technician Education in Vacuum Technology,NSF,2020-10-01,2023-09-30,300000,"This project will develop an electronic textbook (E-book) to support vacuum technology education.  Vacuum technology is a critical, enabling technology for many industries, with semiconductor manufacturing being one of the largest.  According to the 2019 report from the Semiconductor Industry Association, the global semiconductor industry is a key growth sector in the global economy, with the US semiconductor industry accounting for almost half the global market share in 2018.  US-based industry semiconductor sales exceeded $200 billion in 2018 and the industry employs over 241,000 direct jobs.  Currently, a cohort of community colleges prepares manufacturing technicians for the US semiconductor industry.  Preparing technicians for this industry is a challenge for community colleges especially in complex technologies such as vacuum technology.  One of the challenges is finding technician-level textbooks and equipping learning environments that facilitate the development of industry-needed skills.  The E-book is expected to fill this need through its text and its associated animations, tutorials, video demonstrations, and interactive assessments.<br/><br/>This project will convert the first four chapters of the text ""Introduction to Vacuum Technology"" by David M. Hata into a modern electronic book. This format will increase access to vacuum technology instructional resources for both students and incumbent workers.  In addition, the project will develop a laboratory guide to help community college instructors develop hands-on learning environments for their students.  This laboratory guide will present options for implementing vacuum training systems, along with video demonstrations of equipment set-up and operation for laboratory experiments.  All materials will be classroom-tested at Erie Community College, Normandale Community College, and other partner colleges.  Erie Community College and Normandale Community College will license the e-book and associated resources through a Creative Commons license, and disseminate it with help of The Society of Vacuum Coaters, a professional society, and Lesker, Inc., a vacuum equipment supplier.

Surge level simulations using coupled circulation (ADvanced CIRCulation, ADCIRC) and wave (SimulatingWAves Nearshore, SWAN) models will be carried out using two recent hurricanes (Harvey and Irma) as test cases.  The simulations will include forcing using observed and analytical wind models, and multiple runs with varying hurricane sizes, intensities, tracks, forward speed, angle of approach, and bathymetry features will be performed and analyzed. The project activities will involve HBCU graduate and undergraduate students and will assist in the education of well-rounded researchers and engineers capable of addressing multidisciplinary environmental challenges, such as hurricane storm surges. This will be achieved by providing learning-by-doing experiences through research, training, and multidisciplinary courses while addressing a real, global, and societally relevant challenge. Qualified minority, women, and veteran students will be recruited for the project which will provide them with a unique learning opportunity in a critically needed field. In addition, the project will promote retention and entice capable undergraduate students to pursue graduate degrees. Summer activities will be carried out to attract talented high school students to engineering education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigation results are expected to inform current hurricane storm surge understanding and support multidisciplinary engineering education and research.

2000088.xml,RUI: Rational Schur Functions and their Applications,NSF,2020-06-01,2025-05-31,119703,"This project lies at the intersection of operator theory and complex analysis, two areas of pure mathematics. Operator theory began with the study of matrices (arrays of numbers), and by the early twentieth century, had given much of the mathematical foundation for quantum mechanics. Since then, operator-theoretic techniques have had several applications, especially in constructing and studying a variety of useful functions, i.e., rules that encode specific types of information. For example, in control engineering, setups such as autopilot systems that accept inputs, receive feedback, and release outputs can be modeled with general matrices (or operators), while a system’s key information is often encoded in its transfer function. Recently, operator theory techniques have also been used to decompose signals into simple pieces, via something called a wavelet construction. In this project, the principal investigator will use operators to study problems related to a specific class of functions, called rational functions, which appear in such applications. Many of these problems have parts that are amenable to undergraduate research, and much of the research in this project will be explored alongside diverse groups of undergraduate researchers.<br/><br/>More precisely, this project concerns rational functions in one and more variables that are bounded on certain domains. Such rational functions include finite Blaschke products (FBPs), which have played significant roles in factorization, interpolation, and approximation problems in complex analysis. Recently, FBPs have arisen in the context of a famous open problem in operator theory called Crouzeix’s conjecture, which basically says that the numerical range of a bounded operator on a Hilbert space is a 2-spectral set for that operator. The first goals of this project are to use FBPs to investigate and solve various cases of Crouzeix’s conjecture, use Crouzeix’s conjecture to ask and answer new questions about FBPs, and to explore related questions about spectral sets, compressed shifts, and truncated Toeplitz operators. The second topic of this project concerns multivariate (rational and non-rational) functions on the bidisk and polydisk. Specifically, the second main goal is to use model/realization theory to systematically characterize the structure and fine boundary regularity of bounded analytic functions on the bidisk and polydisk. This goal is motivated by recent work on both the structure of rational inner functions near boundary singularities and new canonical realization formulas for general bounded analytic functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000324.xml,Collaborative Research: Excellence in Research: Interactive Effects of Dietary Fat and Gut Microbiota on Neurobehavioral Development in Gallus gallus,NSF,2020-10-01,2024-09-30,972936,"Dietary fat is not only an important source of energy in human and animal diets, but it can also result in production of metabolites that may alter specific physiological functions in living organisms, including those associated with behavior. Dietary fat can impact both the composition of the gut microbiome and the generation of metabolites by the gut microbiome. Using chickens (Gallus gallus) as a vertebrate model, this study will investigate the interactive effects of dietary fat type and quantity on the composition of metabolites produced by gut microbiota, and will identify consequent changes in brain function (neurotransmitter signaling) and bird behavior. This study will utilize cutting-edge analytical techniques including genomics, metagenomics, gene expression, and electrophysiology to examine these interactive effects, with this work being conducted by both faculty and student researchers at three collaborating institutions. This study will provide mentored research experiences to more than a dozen biological and animal science students from the historically black institutions (HBCUs) involved in this project, as well as training three PhD students. Results from this study are expected to lead to a more complete understanding of how dietary fat types and the microbiota impact animal health, with potential applications to human health and the agricultural production of chickens. By involving undergraduate students from two HBCUs in the research, the project will help motivate impactful scientific researchers of the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that dietary fat type and concentration impact the physiological and behavioral conditions of animals with respect to nutrient levels, brain function, and reactivity to stress. However, the molecular mechanisms by which dietary fat and gut microbiota interact to influence the central serotonergic system are yet to be elucidated in birds. In this study, male and female chickens of varying ages will serve as model vertebrate animals to understand how changes in dietary fat type and concentration impact the activity of the central serotonergic system. Changes in gut microbiota in response to diet and age will be evaluated through 16S rRNA sequencing and shotgun metagenomics. Resulting shifts in metabolites produced from intestinal microbial fermentation processes will be determined by metabolomics, and relevant metabolites will be tracked from the gut through the blood, and to the brain. A systems-based analysis will enable the identification of metabolites that cross the blood-brain barrier to potentially modulate brain signaling and serotonin synthesis. Changes in bird behavior will be studied by using video recordings and software to perform neurobehavioral analysis. Expression levels of genes involved in production of behavior-modulating neurotransmitters will be quantified as correlates of dietary fat and gut microbiota interactions. The results may lead to improvements in the agricultural production of chickens. This multifaceted project will provide integrative STEM training experiences for undergraduate students and three PhD-level trainees. The project represents a new cross-disciplinary research area in the collaborating laboratories to investigate the gut-brain-microbiome axis, and will impact the research environment at two HBCUs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000483.xml,A Regression Discontinuity Study of the Impact of Mathematics Achievement Fund on Student Outcomes,NSF,2020-07-01,2023-06-30,939673,"Socioeconomic and racial gaps in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) participation can sometimes be traced back to discrepancies in mathematics skills that emerge at kindergarten entry. Importantly, children who exhibit early lags in mathematics development may also demonstrate lower growth rates in mathematics skills later. Consequently, early gaps in mathematics skills may widen over the course of schooling. How to diagnose and correct mathematics shortcomings early is a challenge that K–12 schools must confront systematically. Unlike reading, few states currently have a coherent statewide program for early mathematics intervention. Kentucky’s Mathematics Achievement Fund (MAF)—a statewide K-3 mathematics intervention program—is a prime example of a state’s effort to intervene early on to change a student’s mathematics development trajectory. By using a quasi-experimental design with data gathered during the implementation of MAF, this study will provide valuable information on how states can structure and provide resources to support early mathematics intervention efforts. The project will connect research and practice and add much-needed information to the existing knowledge base that states can use when considering early-grade mathematics programs. The proposed project is a joint effort between the American Institutes for Research and the Kentucky Department of Education and is supported by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Existing early-grade mathematics interventions tend to be one-off, localized efforts, usually without a coherent or sustainable strategy, and often implemented by experimenters or supported by vendors of prepackaged interventions. Interventions that show promising results are typically small-scale studies, whereas large-scale studies often find null benefits. This project is designed to examine the causal effects of MAF on student outcomes in a regression discontinuity framework. In particular, the project will use student-level administrative data and original data collected through surveys and interviews to examine the causal effects of MAF on students’ academic and non-academic outcomes both immediately after the intervention and in later grades. The project will also investigate who is likely to benefit from MAF and under what conditions and conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of the program. The project will contribute to the existing literature in several ways. First, most existing studies on early mathematics interventions focus on student outcomes at the end of the intervention. There is evidence that large, short-run effects on student scores in early grades could dissipate over time. By tracking some 3rd-grade students into high school, the project plans to examine the extent to which the short-term benefits of the MAF program, if any, persist over time. Further, the project will also explore how MAF may affect other aspects of children’s schooling experiences such as possible spillover effects of MAF on other subjects and non-test outcomes like middle school course-taking and student engagement. In this way, the proposed project seeks to catalyze new knowledge that will help inform the discussion on systematic, coherent early-grade mathematics policies at the state level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this project is to develop new advanced solutions for wireless access networks with the objectives of increasing network throughput and maximizing overall network utilities.  Long-serving model-based solutions are facing severe limitations due to delays in tracking the ever-changing radio and network environment as well as measurement inaccuracies.  The main novelty of this project is to bring new tools based on artificial neural networks (ANN) to meet those challenges.

Innovations in UAV technology have increased the types and volume of data that can be collected for use by industries such as agriculture, law enforcement, environmental monitoring and remediation, and utilities.  However, to inform these industries, the collected data must be analyzed and interpreted. Recent investments by New York State and private industry in Central New York have increased the demand for UAV-related research, development, and innovation. It has also increased the demand for technicians skilled in UAV data analysis and interpretation. This project will develop new stackable credentials, including a micro-credential and certificate, that will be embedded within an associate of applied science degree in Geospatial Science and Technology.  These credentials will be designed to meet the needs of traditional students, adult learners, and industry. The project will also develop applied learning, outreach, and engagement activities to broaden participation in the program, including participation of women and economically disadvantaged individuals.  In this way, the project has the potential to increase the number and diversity of individuals entering the UAV/geospatial technology workforce, where they can have stable careers with compensation that is higher than the living wage level. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to meet industry needs for a technical workforce with competencies in analyzing and applying geospatial and UAV-collected data, as well as to broaden participation in the field. The project will develop a new UAV-data analytics curriculum that includes a 24-credit certificate program and a three-course micro-credential, both of which will be embedded within a Geospatial Science and Technology (GST) associate of applied science degree program. The GST degree program includes courses in geographic information systems, remote sensing, cartography, and quantitative analysis that will be bolstered by and complement the new UAV curriculum. The project will conduct a Developing a Curriculum (DACUM) analysis and use the results to develop the stackable credentials. The DACUM results will be shared with the National Geospatial Technology Center of Excellence and made available as an open resource to other academic institutions. The project will also develop new data sets and UAV-data analytics lab exercises to collect raw data using a UAV equipped with a variety of sensors.  The varied data will be used to introduce students to the broad range of problems they will analyze in different industry sectors, such as using UAV technology to determine the extent of apple tree fungus or to inspect utility lines.

2001098.xml,CSEDI Collaborative Research: Experimental Partitioning of Highly Siderophile Elements at Ultratrace Level for Understanding the Conditions of Core Formation,NSF,2020-05-01,2024-04-30,362638,"Gold, platinum, osmium, irridium, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, and rhenium (known collectively as highly siderophile elements) are among the rarest elements available to mankind. Their widespread use in technology and the arts results in a high cost. It also justifies extensive mining, which has a high environmental and human health impact. The reason for their scarcity is that they were scavenged into the core when Earth separated into a silicate outer layer (mantle and crust) and a metallic core. Even if these elements are highly depleted in the mantle, previous experimental work indicates that they are overabundant relative to expectation for scavenging by the core. Available experiments suggest that the mantle should be completely barren of these elements, which is not what is seen. A likely explanation for this discrepancy between experiments and observations is that the highly siderophile elements were delivered into the Earth's mantle by the late impact addition of meteoritic material after the core had formed. There are differences however between the composition of the mantle and meteorites, notably for ruthenium, and an important question is whether previous experiments reliably predict the scavenging of highly siderophile elements in the core. These experiments were limited in the pressure-temperature conditions that they could achieve and relies on large extrapolations to make inferences about the scavenging efficiency of the core. A new experimental approach relying on the laser ionization of selected highly siderophile elements coupled with experiments done in diamond anvil cells that can routinely reach pressures of 700,000 atmospheres and temperatures of 4500 K, will allow the partitioning of highly siderophile elements to be measured under core formation conditions without relying on large extrapolations. This work will apply a relatively new technique (Resonant Ionization Mass Spectrometry - RIMS) to in situ ultratrace analyses, which can find applications in a variety of fields outside of Earth sciences, including material sciences/development and nuclear forensics.  The project is a multidisciplinary collaboration between geochemists, physicists and instrument developers, an experimental petrologist, and a high-pressure mineral physicist. The project will support two graduate as well as undergraduate students, who will be trained on a multidisciplinary research project. The PIs will also be involved in outreach at the K-12 level through the French-American Science Festival.<br/><br/>The reason for the depletions in highly siderophile elements (HSEs) in the mantle is their removal into Earth’s core, and their subsequent replenishment by late accretion of extraterrestrial material representing ~0.5 % of Earth’s mass. To first order, this model of late delivery of chondritic material to the Earth can account for the abundance of HSEs in the mantle but it fails to explain the elevated Ru/Pt and Pd/Pt ratios in the mantle relative to chondrites and other HSEs. One explanation for these high ratios is that Ru and Pd may be less siderophile or chalcophile compared to other HSEs, resulting in their partial retention in mantle when the core formed. Testing this hypothesis is however difficult because the relevant metal/silicate partitioning experiments have been done at P-T conditions that are quite remote from those that are thought to have prevailed during core formation. The investigators will study the origin of HSEs in Earth’s mantle by applying a novel ultra-trace element quantification technique known as RIMS to measure the concentrations of selected HSEs in metal-silicate experiments done using piston cylinders and diamond anvil cells (DACs). Through this collaboration between geochemists, physicists and instrument developers, an experimental petrologist, and a high-pressure mineral physicist, the research group will study the effect of nano/micro metal nuggets on metal/silicate partition data, and will measure the partition coefficients of Ru, Pd, and Pt at 0–70 GPa and 2100–4500 K, which spans conditions relevant to core formation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000048.xml,"Harmonic Analysis, Boundary Value Problems, and Parabolic Rectifiability",NSF,2020-07-01,2024-06-30,249892,"This project is primarily concerned with the mathematical theory of heat conduction. The subject matter lies at the intersection of geometric measure theory, partial differential equations, and harmonic analysis. In geometric measure theory, one studies geometric properties of sets via the behavior of some measure on that set, where the concept of ""measure"" generalizes the notions of length, area and volume. In this project, the kind of set that we consider is typically the boundary of some region in space, or of some evolving region in space-time.  Partial differential equations describe mathematically the conduction of heat, the propagation of waves, and many other physical phenomena. Harmonic analysis is a mathematical tool with which one extracts information by decomposing mathematical functions into fundamental constituent pieces. A principal goal of this project is to understand, in a quantitative way, how the geometry of a region influences the conduction of heat through the region, and across its boundary. This project will contribute to the development of the US workforce through the training of graduate students.<br/><br/>The project has three main areas of focus: 1) the Neumann Problem. The PI plans to solve the Neumann problem for Laplace's equation, with p-integrable data, in domains satisfying a quantitative, scale invariant version of a measure theoretic condition which is equivalent to the existence of a measure-theoretic outer unit normal at almost every boundary point; thus, the condition is natural for the Neumann problem, and may be sharp. Eventually, the PI seeks to characterize geometrically the domains in which such solvability is possible. 2) Parabolic quantitative rectifiability. At present, the theory of quantitative rectifiability in the time-evolutive parabolic setting is quite rudimentary in comparison to the rich theory available in the steady-state elliptic setting.  In recent work of the PI and co-authors, elliptic quantitative rectifiability has played a central role in the characterization of those domains for which the Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation is solvable. The PI expects that the proposed work would be a first step towards an analogous characterization in the parabolic case. 3) The Kato square root problem for non-divergence form elliptic operators.  The solution of the square root problem for divergence form elliptic operators has enabled significant progress in the theory of boundary value problems for divergence form equations.  As a first step towards opening up the analogous theory in the non-divergence setting, the PI proposes to treat the Kato problem for non-divergence elliptic operators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Monitoring and modeling evaporation over water surfaces such as lakes and oceans remains challenging. Better quantification and modeling of water evaporation requires improved understanding of the physical processes across the water-atmosphere interface. An outstanding scientific question is the role of the top water layer where temperature increases with depth, known as the inverse-temperature layer, in evaporation. An interdisciplinary team of hydro-meteorologists and fluid mechanics scientists will use cutting-edge field and numerical experiment technology and various modeling tools to address this question. The outcomes from this project will benefit broad fields of the Earth Sciences, especially the study of water-energy-carbon cycles.

2002891.xml,Collaborative Research: Optical Transitions in Metallic Nanoclusters at High Pressure,NSF,2020-07-01,2024-06-30,124999,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This research program contributes to innovations in nanomaterials that are useful in biomedical therapies, sensing, and catalysis. Nanoclusters that consist of fewer than ~200 metallic atoms are of interest due to their luminescence in near-infrared light, bio-compatibility and ultra-small size. The relationship between the structure and optical properties of these nanoclusters remains unclear, which prevents the design of nanoclusters with optimized performance. This program uses pressure to modify the structure of nanoclusters, in order to learn about the electronic transitions that are responsible for light absorption and luminescence, as well as the stability of nanoclusters under external stimulus. This research is closely tied to our educational plans through the training of postdocs and graduate students, by supporting underrepresented groups at the K-12 and college level in science and technology, and by supporting science teachers in the community. In addition, modules that explain the influence of mechanics on optical behavior will be incorporated into undergraduate courses during this program.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>The proposed research is concerned with characterizing the properties of atomically precise clusters composed of gold or silver plus ligands using diamond anvil cell techniques to apply high pressure, and with optical measurements (both absorption and emission) to study excited states.  The experiments will be modeled using electronic structure theory, including ground state calculations to determine structures, and excited state studies to determine optical properties, and including methods development based on second linear response theory and domain-separated density functional theory.  The research is aimed at identifying optical properties such as plasmon to exciton transitions, and an increase in luminescence efficiency with increasing pressure; both properties are of interest to using the clusters in practical applications.  The research includes three research objectives: (1) study of energy transfer responsible for broad absorption & near-infrared luminescence of the cluster material under pressure, (2) determine the source of anomalous multiple emissions of the nanoclusters, and (3) studies of 2-3 nm nanoclusters to characterize the transition from plasmonic to excitonic states.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001584.xml,ANT LIA: Collaborative Research: Evolutionary Patterns and Mechanisms of Trait Diversification in the Antarctic Notothenioid Radiation,NSF,2020-08-01,2024-07-31,144988,"Part I: Nontechnical description&lt;br/&gt;The ecologically important notothenioid fish of the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica will be studied to address questions central to polar, evolutionary, and adaptational biology. The rapid diversification of the notothenioids into &gt;120 species following a period of Antarctic glaciation and cooling of the Southern Ocean is thought to have been facilitated by key evolutionary innovations, including antifreeze glycoproteins to prevent freezing and bone reduction to increase buoyancy. In this project, a large dataset of genomic sequences will be used to evaluate the genetic mechanisms that underly the broad pattern of novel trait evolution in these fish, including traits relevant to human diseases (e.g., bone density, renal function, and anemia). The team will develop new STEM-based research and teaching modules for undergraduate education at Northeastern University. The work will provide specific research training to scholars at all levels, including a post-doctoral researcher, a graduate student, undergraduate students, and high school students. The team will also contribute to public outreach, including, in part, the develop of teaching videos in molecular evolutionary biology and accompanying educational supplements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part II: Technical description&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will leverage their comprehensive notothenioid phylogenomic dataset comprising &gt;250,000 protein-coding exons and conserved non-coding elements across 44 ingroup and 2 outgroup species to analyze the genetic origins of three iconic notothenioid traits: (1) loss of erythrocytes by the icefish clade in a cold, stable and highly-oxygenated marine environment; (2) reduction in bone mass and retention of juvenile skeletal characteristics as buoyancy mechanisms to facilitate foraging; and (3) loss of kidney glomeruli to retain energetically expensive antifreeze glycoproteins. The team will first track patterns of change in erythroid-related genes throughout the notothenioid phylogeny. They will then examine whether repetitive evolution of a pedomorphic skeleton in notothenioids is based on parallel or divergent evolution of genetic regulators of heterochrony. Third, they will determine whether there is mutational bias in the mechanisms of loss and re-emergence of kidney glomeruli. Finally, identified genetic mechanisms of evolutionary change will be validated by experimental testing using functional genomic strategies in the zebrafish model system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2003052.xml,Collaborative Research:  SG:  Exploring the effects of UV light on floral pigmentation,NSF,2019-08-15,2020-03-31,7109,"Plants experience many stresses, including extreme temperatures, drought, and ultraviolet (UV) light. UV light is a harmful to DNA and proteins. In flowering plants, pollen is particularly susceptible to UV damage, but dark pigments in flower petals may protect the pollen by absorbing UV light. The intensity of UV light reaching Earth has increased greatly during the 20th century and may continue to increase, especially in some regions. This project explores whether protective pigmentation in flowers has increased in response to increasing amounts of UV light.  Because flower color is important for attracting pollinators, understanding how it may have changed is necessary to understand how effectiveness of pollination may also have changed.  Pollination effectiveness, in turn, is important for the economic success of many agricultural crops and for the ecological well-being of all flowering plants. This project will also provide research experiences and mentoring for students from underrepresented groups, and will engage the general public through outreach activities at multiple events.<br/><br/>Researchers will test the prediction that temporal increases in UV-B radiation have driven increases in UV-absorbing pigmentation in the petals of flowers. Because UV-B has increased most in polar and temperate regions during the last century, they predict that species with polar and temperate distributions will display larger increases in UV-absorbing pigmentation than sub-tropical species. Additionally, the researchers will test the prediction that species with pollen-bearing structures exposed to sunlight will respond to changes in UV-B, while those with pollen structures recessed within the flower (protected) will not. Researchers will use herbarium specimens and bioclimatic databases to gather data on flower pigmentation and abiotic conditions for 75 diverse taxa with different geographic distributions. They will also sample color across a 55-year time span and will use comparative models to assess whether rapid changes in UV-B have elicited rapid change in flower coloration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000726.xml,Geometry and Topology of Holomorphic Symplectic Varieties,NSF,2020-06-01,2021-06-30,159159,"Algebraic geometry is a subject studying algebraic varieties, which are spaces described by solutions of polynomial equations. This subject started with the work of the ancient Greeks about ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas, and now it has grown to be a modern subject sharing many rich connections with physics and computer science. The research supported by this NSF award will focus on an important class of algebraic varieties, called the holomorphic symplectic varieties, that lie at the crossroads of geometry, representation theory, and mathematical physics. A better understanding of these varieties will bring deep insights in both algebraic geometry and its related fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the PI will build connections between compact and noncompact holomorphic symplectic varieties with a focus on the P=W conjecture, which is a central conjecture connecting Hitchin's integrable systems and Hodge theory. Compact holomorphic symplectic varieties, which are higher dimensional generalizations of K3 surfaces, have been studied intensively for decades. A systematic way to compare compact and noncompact geometries, and to introduce new techniques to Hitchin systems from compact holomorphic symplectic varieties will bring fresh perspectives and fruitful outcomes to the P=W conjecture and related questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2000034.xml,Geometric Variational Problems for Surface Tension Driven Systems,NSF,2020-07-01,2023-09-30,249988,"This project will use tools from analysis to investigate fundamental mathematical models for physical systems driven to equilibrium by surface tension effects. A complete mathematical understanding of these systems is useful in addressing biological and engineering problems of mechanical nature, as it allows investigators to obtain analytical predictions on the implied consequences of physical theories motivated by such systems. At the same time, obtaining such predictions requires one to address hard mathematical challenges, which stimulates the growth and development of new and useful mathematical tools and methods, thus advancing the field of mathematics as well. The project will also provide research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>A first series of questions addressed in this project concern the use of minimal surfaces as models for liquid films at equilibrium. The classical idealization of liquid films as two-dimensional surfaces cannot account for liquid films properties where the thickness of the film plays a crucial role (e.g., the relation between the stability of a given geometric film configuration and the size of the diameter of the film itself). This project intends to develop a model for liquid films as three-dimensional regions with a small volume, which was recently proposed by the principal investigator and his collaborators, and which is capable of explaining physical features not accessible by classical approaches. A second direction of investigation includes rigidity theorems for minimal and constant mean curvature surfaces possessing physically meaningful singularities. This project investigates the possibility of systematically developing them into quantitative almost-rigidity statements, and of extending their applicability to non-smooth settings, with motivations in the description of equilibrium configurations in capillarity theory and in the asymptotic behavior of extrinsic curvature flows. Finally, the vast reach of this circle of ideas naturally leads to an investigation of related problems for isoperimetric clusters, fractional perimeters and fractional mean curvatures, and for geometric flows and equilibrium shapes in diffused interface models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000801.xml,CSEDI Collaborative Research: Understanding what we see in the lower mantle - mineral physics interpretation of seismic tomographic images,NSF,2020-07-15,2023-06-30,213000,"Earth’s mantle thermal convection drives plate tectonics. It is at the origin of numerous risks for populations (e.g., earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis). This process extracts Earth’s internal heat, notably produced by the crystallization of its core.  The core is ~3,500 km (~2,200 mi) in radius and consists mostly of iron with some nickel.  Its liquid outer shell, the outer core, generates the Earth’s magnetic field. Above the core lies the rocky mantle, a hot layer of mostly solid silicates wrapped into the planet’s crust.  The core-mantle boundary (CMB) is located ~2,900 km (1800 mi) beneath the Earth’s surface. It is a complex and critical boundary. There, heat transfer, from the core to the mantle, constrains the geodynamo and powers mantle convection. Deep patterns of mantle flow are observed by refined seismic imaging above the CMB. These structures still challenge interpretations in terms of mineralogy and thermodynamical state. Here, researchers focus on the mantle system. The multidisciplinary team of computational scientists consists of a mineral physicist, two seismologists, an applied mathematician, and a geodynamicist. It introduces innovative approaches to analyze the origin of mantle structures, including machine learning algorithm. The models are constrained with the latest mineral physics data, obtained at the extreme pressures and temperatures prevailing in Earth’s interior. Gradually, the scientists unveil the origins, compositions, and temperatures of the deep mantle structures. Outcomes of the project, i.e., state-of-the-art methods, software, and databases, will benefit the Earth Science community. The project also provides support for an early career female scientist, and training for four graduate students at Columbia University and Princeton University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here, the researchers use the latest shear (S-) and compressional (P-) wave models obtained by global adjoint tomography, without reference to a 1D spherical model or assumptions of correlations between compressional (VP) and shear velocity (VS) heterogeneities. They also use direct inversion, machine learning algorithms, and the latest mineral physics results on thermoelastic properties of mineral phases undergoing iron spin crossover (ISC). They pay particular attention to the effect of the ISC which disrupts the usual correlation between VS and VP heterogeneities caused by lateral temperature or composition variations. They focus on lower mantle structures, mainly plumes rooted at the CMB and possibly slabs in this region. In the process, they are formatting the mineral physics data on ISCs to make it available through two popular thermochemical and thermoelasticity software/database frameworks – BurnMan and Perple_X – that couple with geodynamic codes. With this software/data infrastructure in place, they run geodynamic simulations to understand the effect of ISC on mantle dynamics. Conversely, results of geodynamic modeling coupled to thermoelasticity data are used to synthesize tomographic images to be compared with observed mantle structures. The know-how generated by this project, i.e., methods, software, databases, and results will be made available through peer-reviewed journals and in specialized web sites, e.g., BurnMan, Perple_X, IRIS, github.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is a satellite event to the 8th European Congress of Mathematics:  https://www.8ecm.si/program/satellite-events. The venue of the conference, SISSA is one of the leading European research universities, situated in Trieste, which is one of the most important scientific hubs in Italy.  The meeting will focus on the most recent developments at the crossroads of geometry and dynamical systems, with a special focus on integrable systems and applications to mathematical physics. The notion of integrable system in classical mechanics dates back to Joseph Liouville (1809-1882) and has an illustrious and long history. The modern resurgence of activity was initiated  by the analysis of soliton solutions of nonlinear wave equations like the Korteweg deVries and Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equations. The conference aims to bring together both leading mathematicians that have contributed and are contributing to the success and dissemination of methods and ideas originating from integrable systems in all areas of mathematics and physics and also junior researchers and graduate students who should take over the lead in this fascinating field in the near future.<br/><br/>The renewed interest in integrable systems brought along the invention and development of far reaching solution techniques, including the inverse scattering method and the Sato-Segal-Wilson theory of infinite Grassmannians. The notion of integrable systems has since expanded considerably and often refers to a wide range of techniques. The development of techniques and new classes of integrable models has both cross-fertilized and received input from distant areas of mathematics and physics.  There will be two types of presentations: (i) 25-30  plenary talks by leading specialists in the fields of geometry, dynamics, and integrability. (ii) Poster session mostly for young researchers working in the fields, with 10 minutes introductory oral presentation for each of them. The scientific background of the conference is based on relationships between several popular areas of research. Thus, it has a potential to attract young mathematicians,  minorities and women to participate in exciting cross-disciplinary research and look for new applications of their research in other fields of science. The results of this event will be disseminated by the participants from around the world. https://indico.sissa.it/event/41/<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They were pulled up with nets, scooped up from seabeds with grabs, and hand-collected by divers, all contributing to a library of biodiversity that captures the state of life in the ocean - year after year, decade after decade. The broadest evolutionary scope of those collections is in the marine invertebrates, animals without backbones - sea stars, corals, worms, jellyfish, crabs, and thousands of other animals. That library of preserved marine invertebrates is our essential guide to the diversity of ocean life across the globe. And because they encapsulate data from the moment they were picked up, these institutional collections also act as a time machine, letting us use the past to understand how our present will become the future. But there is a problem - vast numbers of these specimens are essentially invisible outside of a tiny community of museum specialists. The only record of these specimens' existence is on labels enclosed in the jars with the preserved animals or in paper logbooks on a shelf. These specimens will remain nearly undiscoverable on museum shelves until their core descriptive information is made digitally available. Therefore, this project will create public digital records for over 7.5 million specimens from our nation's legacy of marine exploration, thereby making the immense investment in the specimens' acquisition available to 21st Century biodiversity and ecosystems research. Because these specimens provide a visible and tangible window into our oceans' enchanting biodiversity, this project will involve STEM educators and student educators in the digitization effort, so that they will be able to reflect their science experiences directly back to the classroom. The public will be involved virtually, by contributing transcription of specimen label data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digitization of alcohol-preserved marine specimens has never been carried out on this scale. A major challenge lies in the location of the data: written, typed, or printed on labels in the jars with the specimens. In many cases, that will require opening the jar, extracting the label, and either transcribing it directly or photographing it for later transcription - for hundreds of thousands of jars. The immediate participants in this program will digitize most or all of the marine invertebrate collections at nineteen institutions across the country, more than doubling the number of digital records for marine invertebrates in the U.S. All data will be publicly available through existing data portals, including iDigBio.org, using standardized data formats, thereby dramatically enhancing the accessibility of biodiversity data for comprehensive, systems-based analysis of ocean ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002771.xml,"Topology, Geometry and Physics",NSF,2020-07-01,2025-06-30,305324,"This project will study the behavior of solutions to certain systems of partial differential equations that are thought to give information about the underlying structures of four dimensional spaces. The equations of interest came from high energy physics where they were introduced as very symmetric models for elementary particle interactions.  Basic question to address with regards to solutions are these:  Are there finitely many or infinitely many solutions for the specific applications?  In either case, what do the solutions look like?  And what are their implications with regards to four dimensional spaces?  By way of background:  The equations are far too complicated for a computer to solve (let alone to solve by hand).  Because of this, almost all information about the solutions must be obtained via a detailed analysis of the equations themselves.  With regards to questions about four dimensional spaces, the central issue here is to understand the list of possible four dimensional spaces.  This last question is also relevant to physics by virtue of the fact that the observable universe has four dimensions--three spatial dimensions and then the time direction.  Since the equations of interest come from high energy physics theory and are close cousins to others used there and in condensed matter physics, the analysis tools developed in this project may also find applications to questions in these other fields.  There is also an important educational support aspect of this project that is meant to bring graduate students up to speed on the relevant geometry, topology and analysis.<br/><br/>The research in this prject has three primary focus points.  The first concerns the behavior of the solutions to the Kapustin-Witten equations on the product of a three-dimensional manifold and the half-line with singular boundary conditions at one end given by a knot in the three-manifold.  The goal for this focus point is to see whether non-convergent sequences of solutions have pathologies that prevent solution counting definitions of knot invariants for knots in the three dimensional manifold.  Two sources of trouble likely arise, one is a novel pathology from the boundary conditions, and the other due to the presence of Z/2 harmonic 1-forms.  The second focus point concerns the algebraic implications of the structure of the solution space for these same Kapustin-Witten equations and for the Kapustin-Witten equations on the product of the three-manifold with the line:  Can an algebraic invariant be defined from these spaces given the non-compactness issues and with the novelty of formally zero dimensional solution spaces?  The third focus point concerns the significance of the afore-mentioned Z/2 harmonic 1-forms and, more generally, Z/2 harmonic sections of a spin bundle.  Such Z/2 harmonic sections appear as renormalized limits of sequences of solutions to the Vafa-Witten equations on four dimensional manifolds and the multi-spinor Seiberg-Witten equations on manifolds of dimensions three and four.  Specific topics and questions not withstanding, the long term goal of this project is to understand the structure of smooth, four dimensional manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2000833.xml,Facilitating Teacher Learning with Video Clips of Instruction in Science,NSF,2020-11-01,2023-04-30,700000,"Videos of teaching have become a popular tool for facilitating teacher learning, with the potential to powerfully impact teacher practice. However, less is known about specific mechanisms through which teachers learn from video. The goal of this study is to build foundational knowledge about teacher learning by using video clips of science instruction within a professional development (PD) context.  The researchers will study the infusion of principles from cognitive science as possible ways to enhance teacher learning from video (these include contrasting cases and self-explanation principles).  PD opportunities that support teachers in making sense of the information about students’ thinking and reasoning as students work are rare. Motivation to address this need has led to the interdisciplinary collaboration in this project that will study the use of video clips in teacher PD and explore teacher learning with and from video clips of science instruction in-depth. The project is jointly funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning, and by the Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12), which supports the research and development of innovative resources, models and tools in order to enhance STEM learning and teaching by pre-K-12 students and teachers.<br/><br/>This design based research project will pursue descriptive accounts of teacher learning by explaining how and why teachers learn with and from video clips of instruction. The team will draw on cognitive science and learning sciences research, specifically literature on analogical reasoning and self-explanation, to unpack mechanisms through which videos support teacher learning and the conditions under which they do so. Evidence pertaining to teacher learning will be gathered through teachers’ participation in video-rich PD, semi-structured interviews with teachers around video clips and prompts for interacting with the clips, and classroom observations. Through intentionally designed video clips and supporting structures, the project will help to uncover how to support noticing of 1) students’ thinking and reasoning and 2) critical and often nuanced differences between more and less productive teaching practices that facilitate students' intellectual engagement in performance assessment tasks. The study has the potential to extend the current knowledge on the kinds of evidence-based learning structures that can enhance teachers’ learning to notice important classroom interactions as they learn to develop ambitious teaching practices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001184.xml,MSB-ECA:  Tropical biomes: how agriculture intensification and climate may alter fire regimes,NSF,2019-08-16,2021-07-31,197744,"Forests and savannas are largest and diverse ecosystems. They house some of the largest agricultural frontiers. The rapid expansion of agriculture in such regions is responsible for the production and export of agricultural commodities as well as releasing enormous amounts of carbon to Earth's atmosphere. Many of these agricultural achievements have come at a high environmental cost:  deforestation and vegetation degradation. Over the next few decades, agricultural pathways will determine the distribution of forests and savannas and whether they retain the capacity to sustain key global ecosystem services or enter a downward spiral with accelerating disturbances that severely degrade native ecosystems, with global consequences. This study will quantify how disturbance regimes may shift as agriculture intensifies and the environment changes. The hypotheses are that (1) fire suppression associated with ongoing agricultural intensification will change the likelihood of catastrophic wildfires, and (2) projected changes in climate may results in more frequent, high-intensity fires. The project outcomes could inform regional land and fire management, particularly the development of new strategies to avoid catastrophic wildfires that can damage infrastructure; negatively impact human health and well-being; and release large amounts of carbon to the atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will apply remote sensing imagery, statistical analyses, and numerical modeling to build a clearer understanding of the spatially varying synergies between climate, land use, and fire regimes in forests and savannas at a global scale. It will evaluate how burned area and fire frequency change as a function of environmental change and agricultural intensification, as well as how fire suppression and future environmental changes may alter the probability of widespread wildfires. Through remote sensing analyses, this project will advance understanding of fire disturbance regimes in forests and savannas worldwide, providing new insights into the unquantified thresholds that may lead to large-scale ecosystem change under future climate and land-use changes. To do so, the study focuses on four key components. First, reconstructing fire histories in forests and savannas using standard remote sensing products (e.g. Landsat, MODIS). Second, quantifying uncertainties inherent to the existing maps of land-use transitions in the agricultural frontier. Third, building a statistical model of changes in fire regime metrics as a function of land-use change, agriculture intensification, and climatic extremes. Fourth, improving the spatially explicit fire model (FISC) that will be used to simulate potential trajectories of fire regimes, and will also be applicable to forest-savanna areas in the rest of the globe, under scenarios of land-use and environmental change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000847.xml,The Effect of Geographic Locale on Work-Related Experiential Learning Opportunities,NSF,2020-08-01,2024-07-31,690027,"The project examines how students’ work-related experiential activities (WREAs) may be affected by their institution’s geographic proximity to major economic and workforce hubs. WREAs include internships, co-ops, practicums, job shadowing, and other similar opportunities that enable students to apply knowledge in an authentic setting and that lead to successful and productive employment.  The research will fill a knowledge gap by empirically documenting the influence of locale on internships and similar professional development opportunities for students. The research is guided by proximity research, constructs implicit in critical human geography that can be examined through dimensions of socio-spatial relations, and the notion of opportunity structures, defined as the full range of opportunities available to students that organize their education and future trajectories. The study will offer thoughtful insight into the employability discourse and demonstrate the importance of the contextual nuance of geographic locale. The study is expected to produce information about the impact of geographic locale on professional development opportunities for students and help strengthen the STEM pipeline from education to the workforce, particularly for students who may be less connected to major workforce hubs.<br/><br/>Guided by proximity research, the researchers will employ a mixed methods design to  answer the following research questions: (1) How and to what extent does geographic locale affect STEM students’ access to work-related experimental activities? (2) Do students, university career officials, and/or new employees perceive access to or benefit from WREAs differently based on their institution’s geographic locale? (3) Are there other facets of structural opportunities that intersect with locale that further affect students’ access to or perceptions of WREAs? (4) Does WREA participation affect time to degree and/or time between degree completion and job offer? (5) For recent graduates, who have not secured employment, does their locale contribute to the reason for unemployment, and was their participation in WREAs different from that of peers who have acquired employment? And (6) Do employees who participate in WREAs receive higher salary offers than peers who do not participate in WREAs?  Survey data will be collected in multiple phases from enrolled students, employers, and recently hired alumni employees who recruit from five public universities in Georgia, and geospatial analyses will visually situate students in the study, institutions, and WREA locations.

As a result, induced seismicity has become a focal point of earthquake science in the United States over the last few years; however, much remains to be learned about the mechanisms of induced seismicity.  In this research the well-recorded 2011 Prague, OK earthquake sequence will be used to investigate deformation on a scale not commonly obtainable in seismicity studies (earthquake location with precision ~10 meters). Such well-located earthquakes allow for better understanding of how complex faults fail.  Furthermore, laboratory experiments on the rocks from the Prague area will provide information on how strong and stable the faults are, and how pumping fluids into the faults might promote earthquakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Prague sequence contains three earthquakes greater than Mw5 and their robust aftershock sequences, as well as the foreshock sequences for two large events. The precision with which the Prague earthquakes can be located allows the failure processes to be considered on a scale comparable to fault structures measured in studies of exhumed faults. In addition, complementary laboratory experiments on lithologies from the Prague area will allow study of the effects of fluid pressure on fault strength and stability. The ultimate goal is to use the Prague dataset to probe the influence of fluid pressure and fault zone complexity on earthquake nucleation, propagation, and arrest. Specifically this work will address the following questions: 1) Do the faults near Prague show precursory activity that could be used to forecast rupture? 2) How does complex fault geometry control rupture? and 3) How do fault strength, strength heterogeneity, and fault stability play a role in induced earthquakes?"
2001290.xml,Digitization TCN: Collaborative Research: Mobilizing Millions of Marine Mollusks of the Eastern Seaboard,NSF,2020-09-15,2024-08-31,25574,"The Eastern Seaboard of the United States (ESB, U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone) stretches from the Canadian border on the Atlantic along nearly 6,000 km of eastern coastline, around the Floridian Peninsula, and along the Gulf of Mexico to the south end of the Texan coast, including 18 U.S. states. The ESB region is densely populated, with 47% of the U.S. population expected to inhabit the counties adjacent to the shoreline by 2021. Habitat loss, pollution, overfishing, and climate change threaten commercially and ecologically important marine species all along the ESB. This project will make occurrence data with map coordinates available for over 3,000 species of mollusks that find their habitat along the ESB, including mussels, clams, conchs, snails, and squid. Data from these ecologically and commercially important species (over 4.5 million individual specimens) will be made available through public online data portals. While the geographic ranges for many species of mollusks are well-known, the extent of their distribution within the seafloor habitats they occupy is unknown. Adding map coordinates to occurrence records for live-collected mollusks in natural history collections will provide detailed knowledge of distributions. Because natural history collections have specimens collected from the mid-1800s to present, these occurrence records can help track distributional changes over time and lead to better fisheries and conservation management.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One hundred million mollusk specimens have been documented in natural history collections across North America, and the breadth, depth, and growth of these collections is exceptionally well-known compared to other invertebrate taxa. Mollusks are among the best sampled group of animals, with some species having over 2,000 digital records available in natural history collections making them extremely well-suited for environmental and biogeographical studies that track faunal change over time and space. However, already-digitized mollusk lots are missing essential data such as collecting date (30% of records) and reliable georeferences (85% of records). This project will generate reliable geo-coordinate data for all covered specimen lots using a collaborative georeferencing project in GeoLocate.  GeoLocate will add layers for bathymetric data, benthic habitat, and marine conservation areas. Incorporating bathymetry into GeoLocate to determine the extent of locations will also provide that capability for complex elevational data for terrestrial species. Important trait data will also be incorporated. For the first time, molluscan occurrence data will distinguish between live- and dead-collected specimens, with a defined vocabulary for traits added to each record. Due to the long persistence of molluscan shells, the live/dead- collected distinction is crucial for all studies of biotic change using mollusks. Information on collecting dates will be refined where possible to increase resolution for detecting biotic changes. The data will be shared through public data repositories, including iDigBio, GBIF, OBIS, and the InvertEBase Symbiota portal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000167.xml,Index in Dynamics: A Tool to Prove the Entropy Conjecture,NSF,2020-09-01,2024-08-31,140413,"Many problems such as the motion of mechanical objects, chemical reactions, population growth, and the dynamics of the prices on the market can be modeled by dynamical systems, which are defined by a collection of states and a time-evolution law. There is a classical number associated with a dynamical system, called its entropy, that is a quantitative measure of the complexity of the system. An important problem in dynamical systems that has been unsolved for many decades is called Shub's entropy conjecture. It aims at understanding the lower bound of the entropy of a system using asymptotic information of the system. Due to the nature of this conjecture new multi-disciplinary tools from topology and dynamics are needed to fully solve the conjecture.  This project is concerned with developing a tool in dynamical systems, called index theory, in order to advance our general knowledge about the dynamics around fixed points, and with an eye to solving the entropy conjecture. Since this proposal integrates ideas from several branches of mathematics, it will further encourage interactions and collaborations among students and faculty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific research goal of this project is to study the following projects using index theory: 1) entropy non-degeneracy between equivalent analytic flows; 2) the relationship between the growth rate of periodic points and the growth rate of the Lefschetz for analytic maps; 3) the relationship between the growth rate of periodic points and the degree for maps with sufficient regularity on a sphere.  Through these three projects, we will show how to use the index to get entropy non-degeneracy and present how powerful index theory is in finding a topological lower bound for the growth rate of periodic orbits.  Since the three projects are all of a strong topological flavor, these projects are closely related to the entropy conjecture.  As a package, they will provide potential approaches and tools for the entropy conjecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The challenge lies in not only discovering a new material, but also understanding its technologically relevant properties. If advancements in technology are to occur - and such advancements are critical if the United States is to remain the leader in science - the discovery and understanding of new materials are critical. This fundamental research project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research, involves the design, discovery, and crystal growth of new materials for advanced technologies. Specifically, the research team is focused on new materials for laser applications. The aim is to discover materials that enable lasing technologies, i.e. coherent radiation, in the ultraviolet and deep-ultraviolet wavelengths - below 300 nanometers. Coherent radiation in these wavelength ranges is critically needed for advanced technologies and devices, and the proposed materials will positively impact these technologies. Finally, there will be a specific emphasis on recruiting underrepresented groups in STEM to the research group as the University of Houston is designated as a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI).<br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>This research project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research, involves the design, synthesis, structure, functional property characterization, and structure-property relationships of new functional inorganic materials -  mixed alkali and alkaline earth borate oxyfluorides and mixed alkali and alkaline-earth metal nitrates - for ultraviolet (UV) and deep-ultraviolet (DUV) nonlinear optical (NLO) applications. An ongoing challenge in inorganic solid-state chemistry is the ‘rational design’ of new materials - to design and synthesize precise stoichiometries that will exhibit specific, and ideally, technologically important properties. Meeting this challenge not only requires synthetic expertise, but also a deep understanding of the various bonding and crystal chemistry requirements for the desired physical property. To further this understanding, the research team at the University of Houston not only synthesizes new materials, but also develops structure-property relationships. In addition to bulk phase synthesis, the growth of large, centimeter size, crystals is planned. Large single crystals are crucial in order to thoroughly investigate and understand the functional properties. Top-seeded solution growth methods can be employed for the crystal growth. The materials are characterized structurally by X-ray diffraction - powder and single crystal - and physical property measurements will include, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and second-harmonic generation measurements. Through this holistic approach - synthesis, crystal growth, characterization, and structure-property relationships - the research team aims to profoundly advance the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This prevents the effective imaging, diagnosis and treatment of deadly brain-related diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s disease and brain cancer. As such, there is a tremendous demand for delivery systems which can solve these problems and effectively treat brain disease. Natural materials such as ferritin proteins have been shown to self-assemble into nanocages and cross the blood-brain barrier. However, a complete understanding of how these nanocages move across the barrier into the brain as well as their structure-function relationships has remained elusive. This research project will combine bioengineering and chemical approaches to understand how these nanostructures interact with the blood-brain barrier and to  rationally design nanocages which have the capability to cross blood-brain barriers and to achieve cellular delivery. The project will provide a robust nanoparticle tool to study nanomaterial-biological barrier interactions and will advance the science for the development of next generation brain drug delivery and imaging platforms and techniques. This project brings together several key technology areas, including nanomaterials, chemical engineering, cell biology and biomedical engineering, providing interdisciplinary training for a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students as well as exposing students from local high schools to cutting-edge research. <br/><br/>The central goal of the research project is to achieve a comprehensive understanding of protein based nanocage/blood-brain barrier interactions using ferritin as a model protein and subsequently to use this knowledge to develop a novel family of protein nanocages as brain targeted, modular delivery platforms with additional functionalities available on demand. The central hypothesis is that with rational design, the engineered ferritin protein can maintain its ability to assemble into nanocages, cross the biological interface of the blood-brain barrier, and also be conferred with new abilities for targeted delivery, loading of therapeutics and/or imaging agents. The research project seeks to: 1) design and genetically introduce targeting domains to ferritin proteins, assemble the ferritin proteins into ferritin nanocages, 2) investigate the nanocages’ blood-brain barrier traversing and cellular targeting capabilities using cellular models; and 3) study the nanocage structure-biological function relationship. The scope of the project includes probing protein nanocage interactions with biological systems to elucidate the genetically-directed nanoscale modular design and providing theragnostic data on the potential treatment of many brain diseases. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop a genetically designed and chemically engineered nanoscale delivery system which can deliver therapeutic and diagnostic agents across the impenetrable blood-brain barrier.  Overall, the experiments will probe nanoscale transport mechanisms and explore the interactions between engineered nanocages and biological systems, therefore laying the foundation for design and production of a new paradigm of protein-based theranostic systems.

They were pulled up with nets, scooped up from seabeds with grabs, and hand-collected by divers, all contributing to a library of biodiversity that captures the state of life in the ocean - year after year, decade after decade. The broadest evolutionary scope of those collections is in the marine invertebrates, animals without backbones - sea stars, corals, worms, jellyfish, crabs, and thousands of other animals. That library of preserved marine invertebrates is our essential guide to the diversity of ocean life across the globe. And because they encapsulate data from the moment they were picked up, these institutional collections also act as a time machine, letting us use the past to understand how our present will become the future. But there is a problem - vast numbers of these specimens are essentially invisible outside of a tiny community of museum specialists. The only record of these specimens' existence is on labels enclosed in the jars with the preserved animals or in paper logbooks on a shelf. These specimens will remain nearly undiscoverable on museum shelves until their core descriptive information is made digitally available. Therefore, this project will create public digital records for over 7.5 million specimens from our nation's legacy of marine exploration, thereby making the immense investment in the specimens' acquisition available to 21st Century biodiversity and ecosystems research. Because these specimens provide a visible and tangible window into our oceans' enchanting biodiversity, this project will involve STEM educators and student educators in the digitization effort, so that they will be able to reflect their science experiences directly back to the classroom. The public will be involved virtually, by contributing transcription of specimen label data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digitization of alcohol-preserved marine specimens has never been carried out on this scale. A major challenge lies in the location of the data: written, typed, or printed on labels in the jars with the specimens. In many cases, that will require opening the jar, extracting the label, and either transcribing it directly or photographing it for later transcription - for hundreds of thousands of jars. The immediate participants in this program will digitize most or all of the marine invertebrate collections at nineteen institutions across the country, more than doubling the number of digital records for marine invertebrates in the U.S. All data will be publicly available through existing data portals, including iDigBio.org, using standardized data formats, thereby dramatically enhancing the accessibility of biodiversity data for comprehensive, systems-based analysis of ocean ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result, highly skilled welders are critical in industries including manufacturing, construction, and energy. In particular, the rapid growth of manufacturing amplifies the need to prepare more welding technicians to meet industry demand. This project will expand the use of welding training systems to provide students with real-time feedback during training sessions. The welding trainer and virtual tracking system will capture and evaluate each action a welder makes to complete an assignment and will create a success score for the activity. The project will use this assessment to provide students with credit for existing skills, to create a student portfolio for employment, and to train incumbent employees or develop customized training profiles for specific workplaces.  This assessment-driven approach is expected to contribute to the development of standardized welding practices.  By engaging with precollege students interested in welding pathways and employer partners interested in providing students with experiential learning opportunities, the project also expects to strengthen partnerships with industry and high schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to create a standardized welding pathway that can be scaled to other institutions and partnerships.

However, current quantum computers based on superconductors, ions, or atoms are prone to error due to imperfections. The solution to this grand challenge is to use new, engineered materials which are inherently immune to these imperfections. However, key questions remain regarding how to make a material that integrates the demanding properties needed to achieve superior performance in a technologically relevant manner. The principal investigators have created a new method to make ultra-thin metals, and this project focuses on understanding the microscopic properties of such metals, specifically bismuth and lead. The investigators will evaluate the impact of thinning these materials down to just a few atoms thick to explore how their properties change when they are manipulated at the atomic-scale. Beyond the scientific impact, this collaborative project will provide interdisciplinary research training for underrepresented graduate students, to broaden participation in science and engineering programs. The project will also develop a unique industry/university consortium to impart the importance of safety in industrial and research settings. This will not only better train future scientists for post-graduate careers in industry, but will also improve safety preparedness in academia.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>The creation of a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) by reducing the dimensionality of a topological insulator from 3D to 2D could provide a unique, robust route to achieving topological superconductivity. This project will investigate the atomic-scale physical, chemical and electronic properties of 2D bismuth (Bi) and lead (Pb). Lead and bismuth exhibit very strong spin-orbit interactions, and exceptionally robust and easily accessible topological insulator properties that may enable the design of groundbreaking electronic devices with dissipationless spin currents, and the realization of Majorana bound states. Furthermore, these elements exhibit unconventional superconductivity, and could be combined with ferromagnetic materials, suggesting the possibility of creating a Pb-based topological superconductor. The investigators enable the study by synthesizing atomically thin, two-dimensional forms of these materials prepared via confinement heteroepitaxy (CHet) – a novel intercalation process that stabilizes 2D forms of 3D materials developed by the PIs. The SiC/graphene interface passivation is investigated before, during and after synthesis to understand how interface reconstruction can enable in-situ removal of the graphene cap for direct characterization access to the 2D-Bi and Pb.  Additionally, removing the graphene cap enables direct functionalization of the 2D metal to explore how modifying the surfaces of 2D-Bi and Pb changes their underlying physical properties, including bonding and electronic character. Finally, the project is developing a mechanistic understanding of how the structure and interfacial interactions with SiC and graphene impact electronic structure of 2D-Bi and 2D-Pb and elucidate how they differ from thin films deposited by traditional methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since there are many symmetries in nature, and since linear methods are powerful and efficient, this subject has found numerous applications in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and computer science. Classically, representations of finite or compact groups were studied. The current project concerns representations of infinite, non-compact, algebraic groups, and the PI and his collaborator will study more recent mathematical structures such as Lie supergroups, quantum groups, and double affine Hecke algebras. Each of these topics has been an active area of modern mathematical research for many years, yet many important questions remain open. The resolution of the questions answered in this project will lead to significant new applications in number theory, combinatorics, and physics.<br/><br/>The main part of the project is dedicated to the study of automorphic representations and will be pursued by the PI and an Israeli collaborator D. Gourevitch. This is a subject of central importance in the Langlands program in number theory, and recently of much interest in string theory. The PI and Gourevitch will employ the method of Whittaker functionals, which are a traditional tool for studying large automorphic representations. However the PI and collaborators have recently introduced a more refined class of functionals, which are well-adapted to studying small representations. This will have applications to quantum gravity, where small automorphic representations arise as certain quantum corrections to Einstein's theory of general relativity. The second part of the project will study higher dimensional analogs of Dirichlet series, which generalize the celebrated Riemann zeta function. The PI will study these series using double affine Hecke algebra, which are a traditional tool for understanding the symmetries of Macdonald polynomials -- themselves a central object of study in algebraic combinatorics. The PI and collaborators have recently discovered a new class of representations of these algebras, called metaplectic representations, that hold considerable promise for studying multiple Dirichlet series. The third part of the project will develop the theory of Capelli differential operators. These operators have their origin in classical invariant theory, which comprised a large part of 19th century mathematics. They also played a key role in Atiyah-Bott-Patodi approach to the index theorem, which is a highlight of 20th century mathematics.

Brine fly larvae and brine shrimp must maintain a much lower salt content than their environment, which is an energetically costly process. However, the cellular mechanisms by which they achieve this unique feat are poorly understood. The work in this project will deduce how these two organisms adapt cellular mechanisms to retain water and expel salt within environments that strongly favor the opposite. The ability to compare and contrast the mechanisms utilized by these substantially different species to combat this environmental stress will provide critical insights into their adaptation. This collaborative study links research and teaching at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center and Illinois State University and will immerse graduate and undergraduate students in a rigorous and interdisciplinary educational setting, providing 1) a project-research-based course and 2) continuing laboratory research opportunities for undergraduates, thus creating a pathway to recruit  undergraduate students into biological research. in addition to their standard training in research methods.  The graduate students involved in the research efforts will also be provided with unique training on how to teach (within a course) and to become a mentor (within the laboratory).

The results from this project will be disseminated by peer-reviewed publications, invited lectures, and presentations at scientific meetings.<br/><br/>The ion-transport mechanisms that allow brine shrimp and brine fly larvae adaptation to extreme salinities remain largely unknown. This project utilizes novel integration of bioinformatics, biochemistry, and electrophysiology, to identify such ion- transporters, study their functional properties, and uncover their role and cooperation to allow these animals to thrive in an environment where all other animals die. Several hypotheses organized in three independent research aims will be tested: 1) Identify the ion transporters required for brine shrimp survival in high salinity 2) Identify the ion-transporters required for brine fly survival in high salinity 3) Elucidate the molecular mechanisms of amino acid substitutions linked to salinity adaptation. For aims 1 & 2, target ion-transport proteins will be identified in each organism by transcriptomics, and their functional role evaluated by pharmacological survival assays and siRNA methods and by expression of the identified transporters in heterologous expression systems. An essential player in the adaptation of all osmoregulating animals is the Na,K-ATPase. Most animals that adapt to both ends of the extreme salinity spectrum present radical structural modifications in regions that are critical for the interaction of the transported ions with this protein. To test if and how these modifications may provide an adaptive advantage to the extreme salinity-adapting animals that carry them, the third aim of this project specifically evaluates the stoichiometry and functional properties of Na,K-ATPases with the same structural specialties as those observed in adapting animals.

This enables a class of new applications beyond the simple repetition of industrial activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project leverages a deep neural network-based computer vision system that creates a lower-dimensional representation of the world-view of the robot. On this latent encoding, the robot behavior is trained using a combination of optimization criteria (e.g. training loss) that ensures the generalization of the target task, smooth operation, recovery from accidental mistakes, and ability to choose between alternative solutions to the problem (e.g. avoid an obstacle to the left or to the right). The technology is novel: current learning by demonstration systems usually reproduce an identical trajectory to what has been demonstrated. This might be useful on a factory floor but would not work in a home environment. In contrast, the proposed model learns a generalizable behavior that uses demonstrations to obtain clues as to how to solve a particular manipulation problem and can both identify and learn from its own mistakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2003277.xml,Collaborative Research: MLWiNS: Hyperdimensional Computing for Scalable IoT Intelligence Beyond the Edge,NSF,2020-07-01,2023-06-30,60000,"The Internet of Things (IoT) generates large amounts of data that machine learning algorithms today process in the cloud.  The heterogeneity of the data types and devices, along with limited computing and communication capabilities of IoT devices, poses a significant challenge to real-time training and learning with classical machine learning algorithms. This project instead proposes to use Hyperdimensional (HD) computing for distributed machine learning. HD computing is a brain-inspired machine learning paradigm that transforms data into knowledge at very low cost, while being extremely robust to errors. When completed, this project has the potential to change the way machine learning is done today – instead of depending on the cloud, IoT systems will be able to make quality decisions on the spot, in real time, regardless of connectivity, with long battery lifetime.    This will be made possible by designing: i) novel HD encoding schemes to represent various data in IoT applications including numerical feature vectors, time-series data, and images, ii) a novel distributed learning framework for IoT networks by incorporating active learning to considerably reduce communication overhead and learning costs, and iii) a reliable learning solution based on the error-tolerant characteristic of HD computing.  The ideas developed in this project will be tested on both UCSD and SDSU using a fully instrumented testbed for human activity recognition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002382.xml,RAPID: Evaluation of Pre and Post Blast Liquefaction Soil and Site Parameters,NSF,2019-12-01,2022-11-30,49447,"Soil liquefaction is a phenomenon that can occur in saturated, loose sand and silt sediments during earthquake shaking which causes these soils to behave as a viscous fluid.  This results in loss of strength and stiffness, often causing significant damage to civil infrastructure, such as buildings, bridges, and dams.  Advances in soil liquefaction engineering have aided engineers in prediction of the initiation of liquefaction (triggering) and its consequences, thereby reducing casualties and damage to infrastructure. However, changes in soil properties both during and following liquefaction, and the affect that these changes can have on soil stiffness and settlement require further study to improve prediction of both post-liquefaction response and behavior during future earthquake events. This Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project will leverage existing field-testing equipment available from the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) RAPID facility and blast testing already occurring as part of another NSF award to measure changes in soil parameters as a result of liquefaction. Measurements will be taken before, during, and after blast-induced liquefaction tests that are scheduled in New Zealand. The blast-liquefaction testing will occur at two locations: one with natural soils and one with soils that have been improved by resin injection. The site offers the opportunity to evaluate both native soils that liquefied during the 2010-2011 Canterbury Earthquake Sequence, as well as improved soils that represent a promising ground improvement technique to mitigate differential settlements and surface manifestations of liquefaction.  The results have immediate application to regions of the United States which are prone to liquefaction.  This project will enhance international collaboration among scientists and will involve students in an international research experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this RAPID project is to further understand liquefaction effects on soil (e.g., shear wave velocity [VS], settlement) and site (e.g., fundamental frequency, amplification, vulnerability index) parameters by utilizing equipment from the RAPID facility to measure properties during blast-induced liquefaction testing occurring in New Zealand. Equipment that will be utilized from the NHERI RAPID facility includes: Seismometers, an instrumented dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP), multi-channel analysis of surface waves (MASW), and a 3D terrestrial laser scanner. The outcomes of this research will result in measurements of: (1) fundamental frequency and amplification factors before, immediately following liquefaction as the pore pressures dissipate, and after liquefaction when pore pressures have fully dissipated, (2) VS and DCP resistance before, immediately following, and after liquefaction, and (3) spatial ground deformations (i.e., settlement and lateral movement) at the liquefaction site using lidar scanners. A unique dataset of soil and site parameters will be created for pre and post liquefaction scenarios at two varying sites, enabling evaluation of changes in soil and site parameters as a result of liquefaction and improving our understanding of the effect of these changes on design of earthquake resilient infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2002155.xml,Pricing Services and Products in the Presence of Parallel Delivery Mechanisms and Strategic Consumer Behavior,NSF,2019-08-15,2020-05-31,31057,"Delivery mechanisms are the processes by which firms sell their products and services to customers. For example, in online marketplaces, some sellers choose to sell their products at a fixed posted price, whereas others solicit bids and sell to the highest bidder. There have been many studies comparing the benefits of different delivery mechanisms to sellers and customers under the assumption that sellers offer their products through a single delivery mechanism. However, firms increasingly offer their products and services through multiple delivery mechanisms in parallel, allowing their customers to choose among the delivery mechanisms. The goal of this project is to develop models and algorithms to help sellers choose which delivery mechanisms to operate in parallel, what prices to charge in each delivery mechanism, and how to allocate limited service capacity among the different delivery mechanisms. The models and algorithms developed within the scope of this project will enable sellers to maximize their revenue, while providing more effective service to their customers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key difficulty in the analysis of parallel delivery mechanisms is that the customers are strategic, and their decision to make use of a particular delivery mechanism depends on the decisions of the seller and of other customers. This dependence requires analyzing the equilibrium resulting from customers' and seller's decisions by using tools from game theory and stochastic models. Computation of equilibria is provably hard. This project will identify conditions under which equilibria exist and will characterize the structure of strategies employed by customers in equilibrium. This characterization will be used to identify the features of customers who make use of a particular delivery mechanism, make design decisions on prices and service capacities used in different delivery mechanisms, and to find the optimal amount of information sharing between the seller and the customers."
2002652.xml,A microfluidic based approach to metabolically control cardiac maturation,NSF,2020-06-01,2025-05-31,472015,"Stems cells differentiate into specialized cells and are a focal point for treatments related to injured tissue. These treatments require understanding of how stem cells differentiate into the types of cells and tissues that are needed at the site of injury. Heart disease, which is the leading cause of death in the United States, may be treated by generating cardiac tissue from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).  In this project, fatty acids will be delivered into iPSCs to stimulate them to differentiate and mature into cardiac cells and tissues. The hypothesis is that precise control of fatty acid delivery could cause the cells to mimic the natural developmental pathway. If successful, such control could potentially lead to the development of new approaches for tissue and organ regeneration. Project-based learning activities will engage elementary school students' interest in science. This will nurture their interest in STEM topics lasting throughout their education as well as influence their career decisions as adults.<br/><br/>Genomic sequencing and high-throughput screening have enhanced our ability to understand specific intracellular responses and regulatory pathways. Novel experimental designs are needed to address the complex responses to various biological modulators of cells, leading to tissue specification and lineage commitment. There is a metabolic switch from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation during cardiac development. Recently,  a link between energy metabolism and cell signaling and epigenetic regulation of gene expression has been established. As a result, efficient delivery of fatty acids that participate in the oxidative phosphorylation cycle could be a powerful tool to exercise fine control over gene expression. This project will utilize a unique microfluidic device to deliver fatty acids into the cytoplasm of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). This should direct their differentiation and maturation to cardiac lineages. The investigators hypothesize that precise control over fatty acid availability will metabolically switch iPSCs from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation and thereby consistently mimic the native developmental, metabolic conditions necessary for cardiac differentiation and maturation. This project will play a key role in the scalability of iPSC-derived cells in future clinical applications as well as potentially lead to the development of new paradigms for metabolic induced tissue and organ regeneration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The data will include information about students who completed the program, who did not complete the program, and who changed programs or transferred to other institutions.  These data will be analyzed to identify potential pathways and critical junctions that may lead to student success or other outcomes. The research team from Tallahassee Community College and Florida State University expect that this approach will reveal opportunities and hindrances students face as they pursue credentials in information technology. &lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;This project aims to test the potential of integrating institutional data with phenomenological data to model student progression through post-secondary STEM programs, specifically information technology.  Framed by Tinto’s model of student attrition and persistence, it will use a mixed methods sequential exploratory design with multiple layers of data collection and analyses that merge and examine institutional data and alumni phenomenological experiential data.  It expects that this analysis will identify and verify influencers that support or hinder student success. Quantitative data analyses will consist of descriptive and comparative methods, which will be verified and informed by open coding and thematic analysis of the qualitative data.  The systematic investigation of institutional and phenomenological data has the potential to: (1) generate practical knowledge about academic/career pathways in information technology for use by stakeholders; (2) identify and examine relationships among these pathways, students experiences, and psychosocial factors; and (3) add to the analytical methods available to institutional research professionals to document, investigate, and visualize student pathway information using data dashboards.

Lake Anna is one of the largest freshwater reservoirs in VA. Research is needed to understand threats, manage risks, mitigate incidents, develop capabilities, and strengthen collaborations for our water safety and security. Aerial and aquatic robots will work alongside health and water quality experts from VDH and DEQ to (1) help inform their regular sampling efforts, and (2) provide critical and timely information to guide regulatory decisions.  The HAB is still going at Lake Anna, and it is expected to continue until the first freeze at the Lake. Once the first freeze occurs, most of the cyanobacteria will explode and unload a large amount of toxins, requiring further analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the first report of the harmful algal boom (HAB) on Lake Anna, the bloom has reportedly intensified, and the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) has issued multiple advisories. The most recent VDH advisory (issued on Sept 20, 2019) showed the HAB extending down both northern branches of the lake. The VDH advisories are based in part on water quality data from the VA Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), which collects samples from a series of stations (GPS waypoints where a manned boat is used to collect samples by hand) across the lake. The research team will work alongside water quality experts (DEQ and VDH) to make targeted collections of the HAB at Lake Anna using aerial robots (a drone equipped with multispectral sensors to image the bloom and a device to sample the water) and aquatic robots (a remotely operated underwater vehicle equipped with underwater GPS, sensors to track the plume in situ, and a device to collect underwater samples). These samples will be analyzed for toxins and nutrients, and the data will be shared with water quality experts and members of the Lake Anna Civic Association. Based on 10 years of seasonal toxin data for Grand Lake St. Marys in Ohio, the research team hypothesize that (1) the HAB at Lake Anna, VA will continue to progress and produce high toxin levels through the coming winter months and (2) aerial and aquatic robots can identify, localize, and sample targeted areas of the HAB in the lake. The specific objectives of this project are to (1) use aerial and aquatic robots to target the HAB in Lake Anna, VA and collect samples at strategic locations; and (2) determine toxin concentrations and nutrient loads in samples collected by robots working alongside humans. This information is critical for determining time-sensitive health advisories, and for the communities of people that live in and around the lake. This work will also show the value of unmanned systems to assist stakeholders in tracking HABs in the water; resulting field-tested technology will provide decision-makers with co-robots that can provide rapid and detailed information on the dispersal of HABs in the environment.  The HAB is still going at Lake Anna, and it is expected to continue until the first freeze at the Lake. Once the first freeze occurs, most of the cyanobacteria will lyse and unload a copious amount of cyanotoxins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2002921.xml,MLWiNS: Quality Versus Quantity in Spectrum Sensing with Distributed Sensors,NSF,2020-07-01,2024-06-30,493987,"An accurate map showing usage of the wireless spectrum can be used to inform spectrum policy, determine usage patterns and situational awareness, and evaluate the feasibility of opportunistic spectrum access methods indoors and outdoors, especially in the crowded sub-6 GHz spectrum.  However, the success of creating such a map depends on the quality and quantity of sensors measuring spectrum activity, and how their measurements are processed by a centralized server.  In general, because the sensors operate in an unknown or time-varying environment, many distributed sensors are generally needed to compensate for this uncertainty.  As a result, the cost, power consumption, and size of the sensors need to be very low to allow wide-scale deployment.  This project examines the sensor quality versus quantity tradeoff for a large-scale distributed measurement system that infers wireless activity throughout a region. Knowledge of the activity of the spectrum is hampered by the lack of accurate real-time measurements on a truly large scale and deploying a large number of sensors is hampered by cost, power, and complexity.  The research addresses the important aspect of how to commoditize the hardware and drive the cost and power down by an order of magnitude, thus potentially paving the way to large spectrum data sets.  The work will be used to seed projects at an existing Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Notre Dame.  The results will be disseminated to the research community to encourage discussions about how spectral occupancy can be measured reliably in a low-cost and scalable manner.<br/><br/>A spectrum sensor is, at its heart, a power detector for frequency bands of interest. Traditionally, such a sensor is evaluated as a radio since it generally tunes and down-converts its input to an intermediate-frequency or baseband signal, digitizes, filters, and then analyzes the power spectrum.  The standard performance specifications of a radio include sensitivity, linearity, bandwidth, image-rejection, frequency stability, phase noise, and dynamic range.  Meeting stringent requirements on these specifications contributes directly to cost and power consumption.  However, spectrum mapping system performance is also determined by the ability of the centralized server to infer activities over a whole region from a widely distributed set of sensors. This research focuses on relaxing many sensor requirements, and analyzing how a real-time spectrum mapping system that uses machine-learning performs when the number of sensors is increased to compensate for the reduced capability per sensor.  The effort seeks to show that there is an advantageous trade-off of quantity over quality---the information learned from additional sensors in a large-scale deployment easily compensates for their reduced individual capabilities, especially when accounting for cost and power consumption. Implications for computational and network load requirements and sensor size are also considered. This research effort is an innovative whole-system approach to determining the quality-quantity contour for distributed spectrum measurements.  The effort will: (i) establish models, metrics, and fidelity criteria for the performance of a machine-learning radio-frequency spectrum sensing system with distributed sensors; (ii) examine opportunities to dramatically reduce sensor cost and power consumption; (iii) build an extensive test and measurement platform of sensors to validate the assumptions, analyses, methods and conclusions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2000408.xml,"Collaborative Research: Chemistry in the Arctic: Clouds, Halogens, and Aerosols (CHACHA)",NSF,2020-09-15,2024-08-31,274656,"This project aims to improve understanding of atmospheric chemistry that impacts ozone, particulate matter, and cloud chemical composition in the context of a rapidly changing Arctic. The atmosphere converts pollutants by processing them into water-soluble products that are removed through precipitation (rain or snow) or by deposition onto Earth’s surface. This chemical conversion of pollution happens through a sunlight-driven (photochemical) process known as oxidation. Most of what is known about these atmospheric processes comes from measurements made at the surface in Arctic coastal environments. The CHACHA team plans to use two instrumented aircraft to conduct airborne measurements around the Chukchi Sea, the Beaufort Sea, and the Alaska North Slope region. They plan to target features that are rapidly changing - above and downwind of sea ice ""leads"" (areas of open water in otherwise sea-ice-covered ocean regions), and downwind of sources of combustion-derived pollutants. Researchers will also use collected data to develop atmospheric models that will be openly available for use by the broader scientific community. The team is composed of researchers at six United States universities (in Alaska, Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and New York) and will mentor a diverse group of students and postdoctoral scholars. Researchers will also engage in several additional education and outreach activities, including an “aircraft open house” and an annual three-day Science Fair in Utqiaġvik, AK. Overall, this project will enable the United States to better understand how rapid change in the Arctic impacts the chemical composition of the atmosphere and to translate what was learned to other regions - including the atmosphere above the world's oceans and in Earth's upper atmosphere. In addition, this project is co-funded by the Arctic Natural Sciences and Atmospheric Chemistry programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will improve understanding of atmospheric halogen chemistry in the gas, aerosol, and cloud water phases, with a focus on how that chemistry is impacted by Arctic sea ice loss and fossil fuel extraction. The CHACHA team plans to conduct eight weeks of observations during the Arctic spring, when halogen chemistry is most active, using two aircraft: the University of Wyoming King Air and the Purdue University Airborne Laboratory for Atmospheric Research (ALAR). Aircraft will conduct complementary sampling upwind and downwind of leads (sea ice fractures), over snow-covered tundra, and downwind of the North Slope of Alaska oilfields. Sampling will occur at various altitudes from the near-surface through the boundary layer and into the free troposphere. The team will prioritize measurement of various greenhouse gases (including O3, CO2, CH4, H2O), reactive trace gases (including NO2, SO2, N2O5, HO2NO2, bromine- and chlorine-containing gases), aerosol size distributions and composition, cloud residual particle composition, and cloud particle size distributions, as well as atmospheric data. These observations will be interpreted in part using 0-D and 1-D photochemical models and a cloud parcel model, to evaluate and advance understanding of multi-phase reactions and the vertical and horizontal propagation of atmospheric halogen chemistry in the Arctic. This dataset will improve understanding of the impact of the rapidly changing Arctic on halogen chemistry and atmospheric composition, as well as to provide fundamental knowledge of halogen chemistry that can be applied globally through models. The team will mentor students, postdocs, and conduct an array of unique outreach and educational activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002385.xml,Collaborative Research: Quantifying the sea-surface temperature pattern effect for Last Glacial Maximum and Pliocene constraints on climate sensitivity,NSF,2020-06-01,2025-05-31,81933,"Predictions of future climate change are based in part on changes seen in geological records of times with different climates. Such times include the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) 21 thousand years ago (a colder time with lower atmospheric carbon dioxide levels) and the Pliocene Epoch 5.3 to 2.6 million years ago (a warmer time with higher carbon dioxide). These periods can be used to estimate the sensitivity of climate to changes in greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. Those sensitivity estimates help predict the amount of global warming we should expect to see in response to future greenhouse gas emissions. However, recent work has shown that the climate’s sensitivity to greenhouse gases depends not only on the average surface temperature change but also on the geographic pattern of that change. Thus, use of geological paleoclimate records to estimate future warming must account for how the spatial pattern of temperature changes in the past differs from that expected in the future. This project will combine information from paleoclimate data and climate models to evaluate the spatial pattern of surface temperature changes during the LGM and Pliocene. It will then develop methods to account for temperature pattern differences when using data from these past periods to help estimate future global warming.<br/><br/>Earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is the change in average surface temperature associated with a doubling of the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (CO2) relative to the pre-industrial atmosphere. The ECS is set by the radiative feedbacks that link surface warming to changes in the amount of radiation leaving Earth’s atmosphere. Recent studies have shown that global radiative feedbacks depend on the spatial pattern of sea-surface temperature (SST). Estimates of ECS based on the proxy record of past climate changes – such as those during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and Pliocene –  have traditionally been based on global mean energy budget constraints and thus do not account for how SST patterns in those states may be different from those in the future. This research will use recently developed data assimilation techniques, combining information from climate models and proxies, to reconstruct gridded SST fields for the LGM and Pliocene that are dynamically consistent with available proxy data. These SST fields will then be compared against those projected by global climate models under CO2 forcing. The sensitivity of radiative feedbacks to differences between LGM / Pliocene and CO2-forced SST patterns will then be quantified using a suite of atmospheric general circulation models and Green’s functions that link warming patterns to radiative feedbacks. By producing estimates of LGM and Pliocene surface temperature patterns and quantifying the impact of temperature pattern differences on radiative feedbacks, this research will improve our understanding of ECS derived from those past climate states. This work will further facilitate researchers’ participation in activities aimed at introducing high school students to climate science, through Current Climate Science workshops for high school teachers facilitated by the University of Washington’s Program on Climate Change and through George Mason University’s Aspiring Scientists Summer Internship Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001333.xml,CDS&E: Efficient Uncertainty Analysis in Multi-physics Phase Field Models of Microstructure Evolution,NSF,2021-01-01,2024-12-31,460000,"Nontechnical Summary<br/><br/>Materials design has been accelerated under the Materials-Genome Initiative by simulating materials with many possible input parameters (composition, processing, etc.) in order to predict those combinations that will yield desired properties, for example, more efficient thermoelectrics for cooling applications.  In any such design cycle, there are uncertainties in the inputs, and it is important to understand how these uncertainties propagate to uncertainties in the output properties.  For complex computations, uncertainty propagation has traditionally been estimated with random (""Monte-Carlo"") sampling, but when each calculation takes substantial computer time, such sampling becomes prohibitively expensive.  A major outcome of this project is the development and public release of efficient software to propagate uncertainty across computational materials-science calculations.  While the focus will be on simulations of the evolution of materials microstructures, the proposed framework will be applicable to a wide range of materials-science-relevant modeling tools. Activities will also be conducted to increase the impact of the project.  These include the generation of an extensive library of 2D and 3D microstructures that can be used as model systems to teach and develop new frameworks for microstructure informatics, the creation of a microstructure-zoo citizen-science platform to assist in labeling and annotating synthetic microstructures created in this project, and the creation of interdisciplinary training tools for uncertainty quantification in computational materials science.  This award will also support the training of two graduate students at the interface of materials science and statistical analysis.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to create sequentially optimal sampling policies for the propagation of uncertainty from model inputs to model outputs. The problem considered here is that of conducting accurate and efficient uncertainty propagation when faced with computationally expensive models, specifically phase-field models of microstructure evolution in thermoelectrics and other materials.  Expensive in this research refers to models for which resources will only permit order 10 model evaluations prior to the need to make a decision informed by the uncertainty analysis. Such models are prevalent in many fields, though the focus here will be on computational materials-science applications.  Specifically, in this project, the research team will demonstrate the efficient propagation of uncertainty across CALPHAD-Phase Field Model chains that attempt to describe the microstructure evolution of materials under chemical and elastic driving forces. These models tend to be highly non-regular in that the model output can differ qualitatively depending on the region in the input/parameter space being sampled.  Moreover, they are computationally expensive, with full three-dimensional realizations of the simulations requiring upwards of 10,000 CPU-hours. In addition, the input/parameter space is often high dimensional, with more than 20 stochastic input conditions and model parameters. One of the main features of this uncertainty propagation framework is that it is non-intrusive, as it works on the input space of the models. Thus, the only information needed is the joint probability distribution of the input parameters, which makes the framework widely applicable, beyond the specific test problem(s) used to develop it.  The framework is capable of reweighting previously executed model evaluations in order to maximize efficiency for uncertainty propagation with negligible additional computational expense.  The PIs will release uncertainty-propagation and phase-field code through a Github repository under open licenses.  They will set up a public Materials Models and Data Management System (MMDMS) to make the phase-field and DFT data they generate in the course of this research widely available and coordinate with other data repositories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000192.xml,Multiplicities and Period Integrals for Spherical Varieties,NSF,2020-06-01,2020-12-31,51936,"Representation theory and automorphic forms are two important branches of mathematics that has connections to many other subjects, including physics and computer science. Reductive group is a special kind of topological groups with abundant symmetries. These symmetries are the guidelines to understanding the intrinsic structures of objects in our universe. The study of reductive groups dates back to the late 19th century. Two of the most important areas are the representation theory of reductive groups and automorphic forms (which is a special kind of functions with extra symmetry) on reductive groups. This project aims to understand the restriction of representations of reductive groups to a spherical subgroup, and to understand the period integrals of automorphic forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is to study the local multiplicities and global period integrals of spherical varieties, as well as their connections to L-functions and arithmetic geometry. Locally the goal is to prove the multiplicity formula and local trace formula for general spherical varieties. Another goal is to prove comparisons between orbital integrals of some relative trace formulas, as well as comparisons between the derivative of some orbital integrals and some height pairings. The main method used in the local theory is harmonic analysis on reductive groups. Globally the goal is to study various relations between period integrals and automorphic L-functions. Another goal is to understand the nontempered terms in the space of square-integrable automorphic forms for the general linear groups in terms of orbital integrals. The methods used in the global theory are the residue method, the relative trace formula, and some ideas from the theory of beyond endoscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001071.xml,Families of Automorphic Forms with Prescribed Local Behavior,NSF,2020-07-01,2025-06-30,350001,"The goal of the research project is to develop a quantitative theory of families with prescribed local behavior. Generally speaking, the idea is that one can study a mathematical object: a variety, a representation, or an L-function, by deforming it in families. A family is a set of global objects that share some common local features. Mathematicians predict that families have equidistribution properties in the sense that their local components should vary in a uniform way within their prescribed space. Building proofs of such properties is a milestone in our mathematical ability to work with these objects. Additionally this project will provide research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Families are crucial even if one is a priori interested in a single automorphic form. Arthur conjectured in 1988 that if an automorphic representation has a local component that belongs to a supercuspidal L-packet, then it is tempered. Over function fields, the PI proposes to establish with Sawin this conjecture for monomial geometric supercuspidal (mgs) packets, that is for those packets that arise from compact-induction of characters and remain supercuspidal after unramified base change. The method relies on combining the l-adic geometry of the moduli space of G-bundles on a curve and on trace formulas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002932.xml,Collaborative Research: MLWiNS:Physical Layer Communication revisited via Deep Learning,NSF,2020-08-01,2022-09-30,222334,"Reliable communication is a workhorse of the modern information age. The disciplines of communication, coding, and information theory drive the innovation by designing efficient codes that allow transmissions to be robustly decoded. Progress in near optimal codes is made by individual human ingenuity and breakthroughs have been, befittingly, sporadic, spread over several decades. Deep learning has recently shown strong promise in problems where the space of algorithmic choices is enormous (e.g., Go). This scenario likewise characterizes communication theory. Deep learning methods can play a crucial role in achieving the aforementioned goals. All resulting algorithms will be maintained on an online repository with full source code and documentation. The practical applications of the new codes will be explored in the context of wireless deployments. The research outcomes will be used to develop new undergraduate and graduate curricula. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The fundamental nature of the research spans two areas of independent scientific and technical interest: finite block length information theory and the mathematics of deep learning.

In parallel, the viewpoint of neural network architectures as encoding and decoding procedures provides a unique vantage point to study their mathematical properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002782.xml,Collaborative Research: Experimental and Computational Studies of Flow and Clogging of Deformable Particles under Confinement,NSF,2020-05-15,2023-04-30,246998,"Squishy, deformable particles play an important role in many fields of science and engineering, from the biological cells to droplets of fatty oils in water that make up emulsions like mayonnaise, peanut butter, and milk.  Microfluidic devices with tiny channels of varying widths are used to process mixtures of deformable particles and fluids and to manipulate DNA molecules. However, microfluidic devices frequently clog near constrictions, which is expensive since the device must be replaced when this occurs. Clogging has been studied extensively for rigid particles, like grains flowing out of a silo, but clogging of deformable particles is less well understood. In particular, it is unclear how particle deformability and stickiness or cohesion affects clogging. For example, will deformable and cohesive particles change shape and flow past each other at constrictions, or will they form arches and clog the system? This project combines experiments of emulsion droplets flowed through microfluidic devices with novel computer simulations of deformable particles to understand how they clog. This work will aid in future designs of critical microfluidic devices involved in industrial processing, filtration, and analysis of biological samples of cell-fluid mixtures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flow-induced jamming, or clogging, is observed across a wide range of systems, from flows of granular materials in silos to flows of blood cells through veins. Clogging is well studied in the case of hard, frictional grains, but is poorly understood when particles are deformable and cohesive. This project employs experiments of suspensions of emulsion droplets with tunable deformability and adhesion flowed through microfluidic devices, along with novel simulations of flows of explicitly deformable particles designed to model emulsion droplets. The combined experimental-computational approach can disentangle the effects of deformability, particle mechanical response, and adhesion on clogging probability. One key focus is the role of particle rearrangements during clogs in unjamming the suspensions. During clogs of granular materials, particles are static and clogs have long lifetimes. However, if particles are deformable, particle shape relaxation and stress redistribution in a clogged suspension can lead to intermittent clog release and avalanching. Additionally, this project will investigate how the Beverloo Law, which describes how flow rate changes with constriction width, changes in the case of deformable and adhesive particles. The combination of computational and experimental studies will aid the development of a comprehensive theoretical framework to predict when a clog will form given the particle properties, flow rate, and constriction width. With the increased use of microfluidic devices to analyze suspensions of colloidal particles and cells, a predictive framework for clogging based on single-particle properties like deformability, elasticity and adhesion is required to design the next generation of efficient high-throughput microfluidic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since currently used cryptosystems can be broken by a quantum computer it is important to develop alternatives to these systems that are resistant to quantum computers. This project will address the classical and post-quantum security of some systems based on supersingular isogenies and of some lattice-based systems that have been proposed as replacements for currently used systems. There seems to be some urgency to achieve this: there has been continued progress in building quantum computers, and it takes several years to design, build, and deploy a new quantum secure infrastructure.  Another part of the project deals with making cryptosystems more efficient. These are important practical questions. In addition this project will provide research training opportunities for graduate students. For the educational component, the PI and co-PI will teach middle school girls and students at local high schools about cryptography and its mathematical background. The PI's involvement in groups of women mathematicians will provide support and mentoring for underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The first part of the project is concerned with the classical and post-quantum security of the key-exchange and signature schemes that are based on isogenies of elliptic curves. Several different schemes have been proposed, and one goal is to analyze and compare the underlying hardness assumptions of the different schemes.  The project will also address the possibility of generalizing these schemes from supersingular elliptic curves to supersingular abelian varieties of dimension 2.  The second part is concerned with making systems that are currently being used more efficient.  This will involve finding more efficient algorithms for constructing curves. The last part studies the security of some lattice-based systems. The lattice-based cryptosystem called ``Soliloquy'' was recently broken by a quantum computer. It is important to determine if other lattice-based systems, such as systems based on Ring-LWE, can be broken by quantum computers as well.

Electrospray additive manufacturing is a process where organic monomers are deposited onto a surface to form a thin polymer film or membrane. This process carefully controls the way by which these molecules are placed on the surface and can be quickly adapted to manufacture a range of different membrane materials. The electrospray process, in this sense, has significant advantages over conventional film coating or casting processes. An example of one benefit of this approach would be that manufacturers could quickly adapt the process to make tailored water treatment membranes in response to emerging contaminants or pollutants in water. Results from this research benefit the U.S. economy and society by enabling the manufacture of very efficient membranes that provide better access to clean water. This research involves several disciplines including advanced manufacturing, materials science, chemical engineering, and electrochemistry. The use of a multi-disciplinary approach broadens participation of underrepresented groups in research and enhances engineering education and training for the future engineering workforce.<br/><br/>The electrospray additive manufacturing process overcomes fundamental limitations, inherent to conventional manufacturing, that prevent reliable and controlled preparation of very thin polyamide ion exchange membranes with tunable properties. This research addresses knowledge gaps related to the use of electrospray additive manufacturing to enable incorporation of a range of co-monomers into the final membrane. This range of compositions allow the manufacture of materials not previously accessible via conventional manufacturing such as doctor-blade or slot-die casting. The research team prepares and characterizes the membranes to determine if electrospray additive manufacturing can be used to overcome mass transfer, solubility, and reaction kinetics limitations associated with conventional interfacial polymerization manufacturing. Additionally, the team uses the new process to incorporate fixed ionic groups into polyamide membranes to precisely engineer their properties via control of fixed ionic group concentration and cross-link density. Furthermore, the research team demonstrates that the electrospray additive manufacturing process can be used to manufacture membranes on a range of different substrates and that a resistances-in-series model can be used to inform the selection of support substrates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000602.xml,Collaborative Research: Algebra Instruction at Community Colleges: Validating Measures of Quality Instruction,NSF,2020-09-15,2025-08-31,1019460,"This STEM Learning and Learning Environments project seeks to advance understanding of algebra education at community colleges.  It will build on prior work to explore further the relationship between the quality of instruction in college algebra classes and teachers’ mathematical knowledge for teaching.  This “knowledge for teaching” is the mathematical understanding that teachers need in order to be effective teachers of mathematics.  For example, this knowledge enables teachers to explore and diagnose why students are struggling with a mathematical concept and provide targeted help.  Despite its critical role in US higher education, instruction at community colleges is a neglected sector of instructional capacity in the United States. To advance mathematics education research related to the first two years of college, this project will develop the Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching Community College Algebra assessment.  This assessment will identify the specialized knowledge that teachers need for teaching community college algebra in a way that supports student growth in thinking about fundamental mathematical concepts. The project will also advance previous work by refining the Evaluating the Quality of Instruction of Post-secondary Mathematics instrument, which assesses characteristics of high-quality instruction in community college algebra courses.  These efforts will enhance the research tools available for studying post-secondary teaching at community colleges, specifically in College Algebra.  Since college algebra is often a gateway course to STEM degrees, this project has the potential to improve the recruitment into and success of students in STEM fields and, thus, support STEM workforce development. <br/><br/>The project involves four primary institutions: University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, Maricopa Community College District, and Oregon State University.  The primary goals of the proposed research are to: (1) develop, pilot, field test, validate, and disseminate the Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching Community College Algebra assessment; (2) refine items in the Evaluating the Quality of Instruction of Post-secondary Mathematics video-coding instrument to address aspects of instruction that support diversity, equity, and inclusion in mathematics classrooms; and (3) theoretically  and empirically explore the connection between the constructs that underlie both instruments.

2000503.xml,Toward a Further Understanding and Improved Forecasting of Coastal Quasi-linear Convective Systems,NSF,2019-09-01,2020-06-30,19294,"There has been a considerable amount of study about thunderstorm complexes and how they intensify and sustain themselves over the continental United States.  Less research has been conducted on how those complexes interact with the cooler, more stable air of the marine atmospheric boundary layer along coastal regions.  This study will consist of numerical model simulations of thunderstorms as they move offshore.  The importance of this research lies in the fact that these types of thunderstorm complexes contribute to a significant portion of severe weather reports in heavily populated coastal areas of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern United States.  The main outcome of this project will be an understanding of the factors that lead to the decay of the thunderstorms near the shoreline, survival of the storms until just offshore, or whether the systems can sustain themselves well out into the ocean.  The lead researcher will interact with the National Weather Service and other government and private entities to ensure that the knowledge is transferred to decision-makers.  This project will also contribute to the future scientific workforce through the training of a graduate student.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher plans to improve understanding and prediction of evolving quasi-linear convective systems (QLCS) as they move offshore from inland regions and interact with the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) over coastal waters.  The project will systematically study the storm scale physical processes through idealized numerical modeling using a cloud resolving model.  The magnitude and depth of the vertical wind shear, the strength of the diabatically generated cold pool associated with the convective storm, and the structure of the sea breeze-MABL boundary will be altered in the suite of idealized numerical sensitivity tests.  Some of the scientific questions that motivate the study include:  Is the low- or mid-level shear more influential on the evolution of the QLCS?  What is the source region of the air being ingested into the QLCS?  How do the QLCS characteristics change as the system interacts with the MABL boundary and as it moves offshore?"

2001460.xml,Invariant Theory and Complexity Theory for Quiver Representations and Tensors,NSF,2020-09-01,2021-09-30,293000,"Invariant theory studies quantities that remain unchanged under symmetries in high dimensional spaces. For example, the distance of a point to the rotation axis is an invariant for the rotation symmetry. Invariant theory has many useful applications in physics, chemistry, and other areas of mathematics. A classical task in invariant theory is to find a finite list of fundamental invariants for a given group of symmetries, such that all invariants can be expressed in terms of the fundamental invariants. In this project, the principal investigator and his collaborators plan to find bounds for the size of fundamental invariants and apply these results to symmetries of high-dimensional arrays (also called tensors), graphs, and questions in theoretical computer science. The principal investigator is actively involved in the training of graduate students in fields close to this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An example of particular interest is the action of simultaneous left and right multiplication of the special linear group on m-tuples of n by n matrices. The principal investigator and his collaborators obtained polynomial degree bounds for the degrees of fundamental polynomial invariants, and this result has been applied to get deterministic polynomial time algorithms for the noncommutative Edmond's problem and for noncommutative rational identity testing.

2002536.xml,Dissertation Institute,NSF,2019-10-01,2022-12-31,497005,"ABSTRACT<br/>Dissertation Institute<br/><br/>The lack of diversification of engineering faculty poses serious threats to the replacement of an aging engineering faculty, the retention of underrepresented minority students, the development of a diverse workforce, and the well-being of the nation. While there have been many initiatives to increase the representation of underrepresented minority faculty, systematic efforts have not been designed to address the completion of doctoral degrees amongst this population. Data show that students, particularly underrepresented students, are leaving before obtaining a degree because of the long, arduous, and uncertain road to graduation. These data also suggest that individuals, graduate schools, and society would benefit from efforts to reduce time-to-degree and degree completion rates. Therefore, the primary goal of this project is to offer a practical and timely experience particularly for underrepresented doctoral students in engineering (African American, Native American, Pacific Island and Hispanic American) to address issues germane to shortening time-to-degree and degree completion rates. The specific aims are to: 1) conduct research to understand the motivational factors that promote and detract from degree progress and 2) to develop and offer the Dissertation Institute (Institute) to provide underrepresented doctoral students in engineering with motivating, helpful strategies for avoiding pitfalls that prolong completion times, particularly those at the dissertation proposal preparation and dissertation completion stages. Current efforts to support underrepresented doctoral students have tended to be local opportunities within specific programs or universities. This project is different from existing efforts because it will systematically examine and positively impact the motivational factors that promote dissertation completion across multiple sites to consider and incorporate contextually relevant factors such that the Institute is transferable across contexts and not limited to local implementation. This transferability is critical to developing a sustainable future program to support underrepresented students. This project addresses strategic goals of the National Science Foundation (NSF) and critical needs of the nation related to enhanced global competitiveness and an improved national economy.<br/><br/>This project is grounded in the expectancy-value theory of motivation and will result in two sets of outcomes: research outcomes and direct benefits to participants. Using quantitative and qualitative research methods, the research outcomes will include: 1) contextually relevant and nationally representative research-based data we can use to inform the Institute's design regarding the success beliefs and values that contribute to and detract from students' dissertation success, 2) measures of Institute effectiveness in terms of participant's increased beliefs about succeeding in and the value of completing a dissertation, and 3) a list of variables to which academics should pay attention when designing transferable versions of the Institute. To achieve the outcomes of our study, we have designed a multi-method, multi-phased study. We will examine and draw on stakeholder needs to develop an Institute that is consistent with literature suggestions and effective practices but also contextually relevant for participants. Finally, we will comparatively analyze the data across sites to allow us to identify the key elements on which we should focus in considering transferability of the Institute to additional sites and/or through online means. The research will directly impact approximately 170 underrepresented doctoral students and will contribute to the long-term sustainability of other Institute models. In addition to improving basic writing habits and skills, Institute participants will gain practical strategies for: 1) distinguishing between behaviors that foster or hinder success, 2) increasing engagement in positive behaviors and eliminating destructive behaviors, 3) developing plans to maneuver through the dissertation phase from selecting a topic to completing the dissertation, and 4) establishing realistic program completion goals and plans for implementing those goals. As a result of participation, students will gain specific skills in synthesizing and evaluating findings from the literature to aid in developing a dissertation proposal or for writing a dissertation. They will learn how to identify helpful, credible resources (people, physical and online) and how to use them effectively. Participants will also learn about developing and writing conference papers and publishable manuscripts from the dissertation, an important part of being ready for future employment. In combination, the project outcomes will have immediate impacts on participants while setting the stage for longer-term benefits."
2001075.xml,SaTC: CORE: Medium: Collaborative: Rethinking Access Pattern Privacy: From Theory to Practice,NSF,2020-10-01,2024-09-30,300000,"When a program accesses data stored in memory, disk, or on a remote server, its access patterns can leak information about its secret inputs and data. There has been decades of work that investigated how to prevent programs from leaking any information by making their access patterns ""oblivious"", i.e., independent from their execution. This project is motivated by the significant overhead that past techniques incur. The project introduces and investigates new relaxed notions of access pattern obliviousness, and discovers new algorithms that achieve these notions with a significantly reduced overhead. The project includes training of Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researchers, and mentoring activities focused on high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project rethinks the definition of access pattern privacy, and considers (but not limited to) a new notion called ""differential obliviousness"". In analogy with differential privacy, differential obliviosness requires that the access patterns resulting from executing a program on similar inputs should be hard to distinguish. The project establishes theoretical understanding, including new lower and upper bounds, of the extent to which various notions of obliviosness impact the performance of programs. The investigators also explore the practical performance of new privacy-preserving algorithms in cloud outsourcing and database scenarios. The project develops open-source libraries for the new, differentially oblivious algorithms and data structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002297.xml,Last Glacial Maximum Tropical Pacific Thermocline Structure and Wind Field:  A Data Synthesis,NSF,2020-07-15,2025-06-30,449701,"The spatial pattern of wind and rainfall in the tropics is not fixed, but changes with time.  The changes can be driven by the amount of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, changes in seasonality, or the presence of large expanses of ice outside of the tropics.  By looking at these patterns during the height of the last ice age, ideas about the links between these drivers and the tropical climate can be tested.  It would be difficult to directly deduce the patterns of the ice age winds.  But when the winds blow on the upper ocean, they pile up warm water in some areas and bring cold water closer to the sea surface in others. In this project, the investigators will use tiny shells (foraminifera) that contain information about the temperature of seawater at different depths.  These shells accumulate on the sea-floor and preserve a history of ocean temperature. The upper ocean temperature reconstructed from shells that fell to the seafloor during the height of the last ice age can then be used to deduce the wind patterns. The project would support two graduate students (one of whom is a woman from an underrepresented minority), as well as providing support for undergraduate summer researchers.<br/><br/>The PIs proposes a plan of database development and analysis that will use the information about the thermocline structure recorded in the oxygen isotope composition of surface and subsurface planktonic foraminifera in the tropics to reconstruct the tropical thermocline and winds during the Last Glacial Maximum. The isotopic composition of the tests of different species will reflect the surface and subsurface density and can be used to reconstruct thermocline structure.  The tight coupling between winds and thermocline structure will be exploited to infer changes in the winds through the thermocline reconstructions provided from the foraminifera proxy data. The PIs will first create a global database of tropical planktonic foraminifera oxygen isotope data from recent sediments. Using this data, models for foraminifera calcification habitat will be constructed and the uncertainty in the calcification habitat quantified. A variety of statistical approaches will then be explored in order to determine how to project the sparse information about the vertical structure of the water column from the foraminiferal proxy data into estimates of the tropical thermocline structure, and to determine how to optimally estimate the long-term mean winds associated with a given mean thermocline state. These analytical approaches will include Empirical Orthogonal Functions, Optimal Linear Estimators, and Inverse Methods. Finally, existing Last Glacial Maximum oxygen isotope data will be compiled for these same species.  The database will be augmented in the Tropical Pacific with new measurements, as guided by the data analysis effort.  Once the Last Glacial Maximum foraminiferal database is complete the data will be directly compared to results from isotope-enabled general circulation model simulations of ice age climate, and also used to produce an estimate of Tropical Pacific thermocline structure and winds using the data analysis tools developed as described above.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These nocturnal predators, which inhabit tropical and subtropical habitats on all major landmasses except Antarctica, are important for controlling insect populations and have hardly changed anatomically in 300 million years. What little is known about their life history and behavior reveals complex courtship rituals, male combat, territoriality, sociality, parental care, and chemical defense with an arsenal of noxious defense secretions. Despite the deep evolutionary timescale, global distribution, ecological importance, and fascinating life history and behavior of Pedipalpi, little progress on their classification has been made in a century, and their branch of the Tree of Life is barely assembled, hindering the testing of hypotheses concerning their evolution. By leveraging technological advances in genomics, microscopy, imaging, and informatics, and integrating anatomical and genomic data, this project will build the first comprehensive tree of life for living and fossil Pedipalpi, train a new generation of experts on these poorly studied arachnids, and disseminate results to the public. Two Ph.D. students and two postdoctoral associates, from groups under-represented in science, will be supported. Each year, an undergraduate, two high school students, and two citizen scientists will be involved in research. Courses on the biology and classification of Pedipalpi, with an introduction to the local fauna, will be presented on four continents. New material, data, and images will enhance scientific infrastructure. Results, data, and educational outreach materials will be disseminated at meetings, online, and via nationally distributed classroom magazines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has four primary aims. (1) Using a high-throughput, targeted enrichment approach, ca. 100,000 base-pairs of DNA sequence, per specimen, will be generated for representatives of all major lineages, 70% of the genera, and 30% of the species of living Pedipalpi. (2) A matrix of morphological observations will be compiled for all species in the genomic dataset and representatives of extinct lineages of Pedipalpi and their chelicerate relatives. The phylogeny and morphology will be used to (3) present a predictive classification of Pedipalpi above the level of genus and conduct monographic taxonomic revisions of four lineages, and (4) investigate questions concerning the evolution and diversification of Pedipalpi. How, when, and where did the major lineages of Pedipalpi diversify, and which key innovations enabled them to do so? Is morphological specialization to life in caves, commonly inhabited by Pedipalpi, an irreversible, evolutionary dead-end? Is sexual dimorphism in the spinose pedipalps (claws) of Amblypygi ancestral or derived, and did it evolve to reduce injury in ritualized male combat, or was it sexually selected?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When these nanoscale elements are precisely architected into well-defined, three-dimensional topologies, they form macroscopic structures that can reach near-theoretical strength with only a fraction of the mass densities of the starting materials. If such nano-architected structures are manufacturable, many applications are possible, e.g., ultra-lightweight, energy-absorbing materials, tissue engineering scaffolds, energy conversion and wave manipulation devices. Current nanofabrication technologies, based on laser-writing, are incapable of creating these nanostructures in dimensions larger than a few millimeters. While a variety of additive manufacturing approaches are capable of creating complex macroscopic three-dimensional objects, they have not achieved capabilities for creating architectures with nanoscale features. This project will advance knowledge in scalable nanomanufacturing of macroscopic objects comprised of precisely defined, three-dimensional nano-architectures for lightweighting and resilience. The researchers will conduct theoretical and experimental studies to understand, predict and control the interactions between light field, digital optics, and feedstock materials, leading to reliable production of large area, three-dimensional nano-architectures. The research requires understanding fundamental science and engineering disciplines, including nanomanufacturing, optics, mechanics, mechatronics, physics, and chemistry. The research results will be integrated into new curricula and projects to give hands-on research and education opportunities for high school, undergraduate, graduate and under-represented students.<br/><br/>The project aims to build the theoretical and experimental foundations underpinning scalable additive nanomanufacturing, overcoming existing barrier in 3D printing, which is to achieve nano-scale precision. The research studies a process to create three-dimensional architectures with nanoscale features under controlled sub-wavelength light field projection onto feedstock primitives. To achieve optimal production speed, a multi-physics based modeling and experimental platforms are established to elucidate the kinetics governing the speed and resolution of the new printing mechanism. The research is then implemented with a new set of instrumentations that enable the parallel production of large area samples with nano-architectures. Additionally, this research establishes theoretical and experimental frameworks to predict and prevent defect generation while scaling up to dimensions over several orders of magnitude. This research enables a new concept of creating three-dimensional nano-architectures. It provides a scientific and engineering basis towards reliable upscaling of nano-architectures to components and devices for applications including structural supports, energy storage and conversion, and wave manipulations."

Quantum dots which are nanometer-sized versions of semiconductors represent a success stories arising out of the nanotechnology revolution. Quantum dots are notable for their size-dependent light interactions.  Quantum dots are tools for neuroscience as they can be used to track individual proteins on a living cell’s surface. Quantum dots occupy a growing portion of the electronic display market due to the vivid colors they produce. While the use and importance of quantum dots are growing, the best performing quantum dots are composed of cadmium, a toxic heavy metal. Indium-based quantum dots are made from non-toxic materials and show comparable color purity and brightness, but struggle in challenging environments such as those found in biological systems. To accelerate the development of new quantum dots, Professor Rosenthal and her research team are using a method to directly correlate the structure of individual quantum dots with their optical performance. In systems where every atom in each quantum dot matters, this methodology can reveal new insights into how complex quantum dot structures yield specific optical behavior.  This research enables scientists and engineers to precisely design and synthesize customized quantum dot light emitters as part of advanced manufacturing efforts.

2001331.xml,Collaborative Research: Developing New Models of Oceanic Magmatism and Source Heterogeneity Using the 8 degree 20' N Seamounts as Windows into the Sub-Ridge Mantle,NSF,2020-05-01,2025-04-30,162149,"Eruptions of lava form submarine volcanoes, known as seamounts, near mid-ocean ridge spreading centers. These lavas can provide important information about what Earth’s uppermost (~ 120 miles) mantle is composed of and how it melts to form the majority of Earth’s crust. At present no studies have examined long chains of seamounts adjacent to mid-ocean ridges to address these fundamental questions. In this study, we plan to analyze over 400 well located lava samples from the 8°20'N seamount chain. The chain was previously sampled and mapped in 2016 and 2018 using the submersible Alvin and autonomous vehicle Sentry. The geochemical, mineralogical, and age data to be obtained under this project will allow us to determine the origin of the magmas that feed the seamounts and nearby ridge. The data will also tell us how those magmas evolve to form oceanic lavas, and how the volcanism is related to regional tectonic processes.  The study will promote advances in the field of geochemistry, marine geology, and geodynamics. This project will provide significant mentorship and training for students at a variety of levels.  It will fully or partially support three graduate students at Florida and Boise State and will provide training for several undergraduates in geochemical techniques and interpretation, and support senior research projects. The project will also support education and diversity by funding two female scientists, one a first-generation college graduate, toward obtaining their PhDs in geochemistry. Both principal investigators are heavily involved in outreach and education at the K-12 levels in Florida and Idaho.<br/><br/>Sparse sampling and geochemical analyses of seamounts scattered throughout the northeastern Pacific suggest the sub-ridge mantle associated with the East Pacific Rise (EPR) has far greater compositional variability then is preserved in lavas erupted on-axis. While the relative homogeneity of axial lavas has resulted in intriguing generalizations about magma differentiation and mixing processes at mid-ocean ridges (MOR), seamount studies have had a significant impact on our understanding of the source compositions for oceanic basalts, the scales of mantle heterogeneity, and mantle melting systematics at MOR. However, many of these studies have focused on dredged lavas from individual seamounts with very few combining in situ sampling and high-resolution mapping from a single chain oriented perpendicular to the ridge axis.  To fill this gap in knowledge about the sub-ridge mantle, two research cruises in 2016 and 2018 investigated the 8°20’N seamount chain that extends ~200km west of the EPR.  The 8°20’N seamount chain was unexplored and virtually unsampled before our highly successful OASIS cruises. Geophysical, observational, and preliminary geochemical data from this nearly continuous chain of volcanoes led us to unexpected discoveries about their construction and revealed extreme compositional variability in the near MOR mantle that was previously only surmised from regional seamount studies in the northeast Pacific. The location, orientation, and preliminary data from the 8°20'N seamount chain make it an ideal a natural laboratory to investigate source heterogeneity and melting systematics in the near-ridge mantle. We propose to study the petrologic processes and mantle sources feeding MOR and near-axis volcanoes though comprehensive geochemical analyses of lavas and melt inclusions from the 8°20’N seamounts. Site-specific sampling using HOV Alvin and extensive, fine-scale mapping with AUV Sentry along the seamount chain, coupled with our previous comprehensive investigations of the 8°- 10°N EPR provide an exceptional opportunity to constrain geodynamic and geochemical models of mantle melting near MOR and determine the extent and length scales of mantle heterogeneity. We propose to collect a wide spectrum of petrologic and geochemical data including Sr, Nd, Pb, and Os isotopes, melt inclusion compositions, volatile contents, and 40Ar/39Ar age dates of lavas from the extensive collection of samples we have from the 8°20’N seamount chain. These results will be combined with numerical models to produce a petrologic model of mantle melting and magmatic processes in the near-ridge mantle. This extensive off-axis seamount chain provides a rare opportunity to probe the compositions of the mantle near MOR and to understand how magmas are spatially and temporally distributed in the shallow mantle and crust. Results from this research have implications for the generation of the majority of Earth’s crust.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project develops innovative decentralized heterogeneous deep learning techniques for large-scale wireless systems. The outcomes of this project lead to technical innovations that tackle several major challenges of the state-of-the-art wireless sensing and management systems, including the incapability of conventional sensing and management schemes in ultra-wide wireless spectrum settings, the difficulty in handling heterogeneous tasks and non-IID data with deep learning technologies, as well as the costly overhead of communication and computation in distributed deep learning for large-scale networks.<br/><br/>This project addresses the unique challenges of large-scale wireless spectrum sensing by developing a revolutionary decentralized deep learning framework. Three main thrusts are planned.  In Thrust 1,  major challenges of complex and large-scale wireless spectrum sensing nowadays are investigated, and an innovative deep learning-based solution is developed for practical spectrum sensing tasks. In Thrust 2, dedicated communication and computation schemes are developed to optimize the performance of the proposed decentralized deep learning framework. In Thrust 3, the very first exploratory effort is made to understand and utilize the intricate role of machine learning in spectrum management, based on the key observation that it consumes wireless network resources to bring in added value to network resource utilization. Experimental testing is demonstrated for practical spectrum monitoring applications.

2003385.xml,"Conference: 2020 Pacific Northwest Summer Crystallographic Institute; Whitworth University; July 15-18, 2020",NSF,2020-02-01,2023-01-31,5000,"NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Single crystal X-ray crystallography is a central method for determining the detailed structures of solid materials.  Such structures are important in understanding structure-property relationships in a wide variety of materials, including those used in applications such as solar cells and batteries.  This method is also widely used in establishing the structures of molecules used as pharmaceutical agents.  Despite its importance, this method is frequently not taught in undergraduate curricula.  The primary goal of the 2020 Pacific Northwest Summer Crystallographic Institute to be held at Whitworth University is to develop the expertise of 20-25 undergraduate students and their faculty mentors in single-crystal X-ray crystallographic techniques.  Workshop attendees will be exposed to a full range of crystallographic topics from crystal growth to the preparation of data for publication and will do hands-on sample preparation and data collection.  In addition, the pedagogical approach of this project helps to i) increase collaboration among institutions located in the Pacific Northwest and ii) develop the teaching and research capacity in the structural sciences at the participants' home institutions.  This award, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program within the Division of Materials Research, defrays participant costs for students and their mentors to attend the workshop.  The diversity of the workshop will be further enhanced by supporting the participation of junior scholars and faculty from underrepresented and marginalized groups in STEM.  <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Research demands on faculty at primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) are increasing, requiring reliable, modern instrumentation to advance research agendas and improve undergraduate education.  Given the cost and required expertise to manage single-crystal X-ray diffraction equipment, it is not surprising that structural studies via crystallographic techniques is often absent at PUIs.  The pedagogical objective of this project is to provide participants with formal and hands-on training in the practical aspects of crystallography with emphasis placed on increasing research and teaching capacity.  This 2020 Pacific Northwest Summer Crystallographic Institute to be held at Whitworth University will facilitate access to a broad user base of U.S. scientists that will encourage collaboration on state-of-the-art instrumentation.  This award, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program within the Division of Materials Research, will provide support to defray the registration and travel costs for workshop participants -- 20-25 undergraduate students and their faculty mentors.  Faculty participants will find that easy access to structural data enhances the innovation and outcomes of their current research programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000580.xml,Collaborative Research: ECR EIE DCL: The Development and Validation of a Scale to Assess Epistemic Exclusion in Minoritized and Non-Minoritized STEM Faculty,NSF,2020-09-01,2025-08-31,175011,"This collaborative research project, involving Michigan State University, the University of North Texas and the University of Michigan, will examine whether epistemic exclusion, a form a scholarly devaluation, may create a barrier to the full inclusion and participation of women and faculty of color in STEM. Epistemic exclusion is the devaluation of certain types of scholarship that occurs when invisible biases in systems of evaluation are coupled with prejudice toward, and negative stereotypes about, historically underrepresented groups.  Because faculty members' career outcomes (e.g., promotion, tenure, and turnover intentions) are determined by how well they meet evaluative standards, bias in systems of evaluation that disproportionately harm women and faculty of color may impede their retention and advancement in academia. The project team will create and validate a scale assessing faculty epistemic exclusion. <br/><br/>Results of the project have the potential to benefit society by providing a tool that researchers can use to investigate epistemic exclusion in STEM faculty.  Advancing this line of research may result in potential interventions and policy changes at institutions of higher education that improve the retention and promotion of women and underrepresented minority STEM faculty at our nation’s colleges and universities.  There is a plan for dissemination to scholarly audiences through peer-reviewed presentation and publications in professional journals that will help inform the research and academic communities.  <br/><br/>This project is supported by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development. The ECR program supports the accumulation of robust evidence to inform efforts to understand, build theory to explain, and suggest intervention and innovations to address persistent challenges in STEM interest, education, learning and participation.  The project was co-funded by the NSF ADVANCE program which supports the implementation of organizational change strategies to address systemic inequities that impact women in STEM faculty careers.  The project was also funded by the Alliances for Graduate Education and Professoriate (AGEP) program, which funds projects designed to advance knowledge about increasing the number of African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native American Indians, Native Hawaiians and Native Pacific Islanders in STEM faculty careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001508.xml,Digitization TCN: Collaborative Research: Documenting marine biodiversity through Digitization of Invertebrate collections (DigIn),NSF,2020-11-01,2024-10-31,71049,"For two centuries, America has amassed an unparalleled collection of specimens from exploring the world's oceans. They were pulled up with nets, scooped up from seabeds with grabs, and hand-collected by divers, all contributing to a library of biodiversity that captures the state of life in the ocean - year after year, decade after decade. The broadest evolutionary scope of those collections is in the marine invertebrates, animals without backbones - sea stars, corals, worms, jellyfish, crabs, and thousands of other animals. That library of preserved marine invertebrates is our essential guide to the diversity of ocean life across the globe. And because they encapsulate data from the moment they were picked up, these institutional collections also act as a time machine, letting us use the past to understand how our present will become the future. But there is a problem - vast numbers of these specimens are essentially invisible outside of a tiny community of museum specialists. The only record of these specimens' existence is on labels enclosed in the jars with the preserved animals or in paper logbooks on a shelf. These specimens will remain nearly undiscoverable on museum shelves until their core descriptive information is made digitally available. Therefore, this project will create public digital records for over 7.5 million specimens from our nation's legacy of marine exploration, thereby making the immense investment in the specimens' acquisition available to 21st Century biodiversity and ecosystems research. Because these specimens provide a visible and tangible window into our oceans' enchanting biodiversity, this project will involve STEM educators and student educators in the digitization effort, so that they will be able to reflect their science experiences directly back to the classroom. The public will be involved virtually, by contributing transcription of specimen label data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digitization of alcohol-preserved marine specimens has never been carried out on this scale. A major challenge lies in the location of the data: written, typed, or printed on labels in the jars with the specimens. In many cases, that will require opening the jar, extracting the label, and either transcribing it directly or photographing it for later transcription - for hundreds of thousands of jars. The immediate participants in this program will digitize most or all of the marine invertebrate collections at nineteen institutions across the country, more than doubling the number of digital records for marine invertebrates in the U.S. All data will be publicly available through existing data portals, including iDigBio.org, using standardized data formats, thereby dramatically enhancing the accessibility of biodiversity data for comprehensive, systems-based analysis of ocean ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2003261.xml,RUI: Exploring Shape-selective Binding of the DNA Major Groove by Haiprin bis(diarylmethylene)Hydrazides,NSF,2020-09-01,2025-08-31,330662,"With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program of the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Thomas Minehan from California State University-Northridge to investigate how tightly a set of hairpin bis(diarylmethylene)-hydrazide compounds bind to the DNA major groove and thereby potentially provide new tools to control when and at what levels genes are expressed. Nature's transcription factors are proteins that control when genes are turned on in cells by recognizing and binding DNA sequences in the major groove of the double-helix. Compounds that compete against transcription factor binding can thus be used to control genes that may be out of control. The  molecules being constructed herein are to recognize regions in the DNA that are widened, mimicking the shape of the double-helix when proteins bind. Efforts to develop molecules that recognize DNA shape-selectively represent important new exploratory directions in chemistry and chemical biology.  Success here could lead to a new class of tailored synthetic agents that modulate gene expression. The research provides valuable training at the interface of organic and biological chemistry to both undergraduate and graduate students. In addition, a new course and teaching resources are being developed to increase the appreciation of chemistry-related fields by non-science students.<br/><br/>There is great need to develop new chemical scaffolds for sequence-specific major-groove binders. Peptide-tethered bis(diarylmethylene)-hydrazides are sterically bulky small molecules with defined distances between positively charged dimethylamino groups. Varying the tether length and aromatic surface area of these molecules allows the design of ligands with well defined distances between the projected positive charges so as to contact the negatively charged phosphate groups on opposite sides of expanded DNA major groove. Four hydrazide ligands possessing varying N-N spans will be synthesized and their DNA binding affinity and sequence selectivity evaluated using fluorescent intercalator displacement assays and isothermal titration calorimetry. These studies, together with X-ray crystallographic data on select DNA-ligand complexes, will be used to achieve optimal ligand structures for sequence-selective binding. Finally, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay is to be utilized to assess the ability of the ligands to selectively inhibit the binding of transcription factors to their target nucleic acid sequences, thus shedding light on the therapeutic and biotechnological promise of this class of compounds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Tsunamis generated at this subduction zone may also impact the U.S. East Coast. This project supports land and sea seismic experiments across the PRT and Puerto Rico. The experiments will define the detailed seismic structure of the PRT, advance our understanding of the PRT, and improve hazard assessment. The project consists of: (1) Three wide-angle seismic reflection/refraction profiles using ocean bottom seismometers (OBS); (2) Four multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection profiles, two parallel to and inland from the trench, and two parallel to the central OBS profile. (3) An array of more than 100 short-period land seismometers deployed across the Puerto Rico island, together with a dozen broad-band seismometers to record earthquakes for 18 months. The project will provide support for training several graduate students and an early career scientist, as well as research opportunities for faculty and students at a minority serving institution.

The PRT is a highly oblique subduction zone, where old Atlantic plate subducts under the Caribbean plate at a slow rate. The PRT is associated with anomalous and unexplained characteristics, such as the widest trench (below 6,000 m), the lowest gravity anomaly on Earth, and anomalous subsidence of the north coast of Puerto Rico. This project will acquire, analyze, and interpret multiple types of data: Three wide-angle seismic reflection/refraction profiles across the PRT with OBSs and an additional line south of the Puerto Rico island; four MCS reflection profiles, two each parallel and perpendicular to the PRT axis; an array of active- and passive-source land seismic stations on the Puerto Rico island; and multibeam bathymetry, 3.5 kHz sub-bottom profiler, gravity, and magnetics. The experiments are designed to address three key questions: (1) What is the shallow geometry of the subducting slab and its lateral continuity along the 500-km section of the trench? (2) What are the degree and spatial extent of hydration of the Atlantic lithosphere entering the Puerto Rico Trench? (3) Does oceanic bivergent thrust system represent double-sided subduction or a crustal retro-wedge of one-sided subduction?

These practices are: create mathematical arguments, use appropriate tools strategically, look for and make use of structure, attend to precision, and look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.   Mathematics argumentation is an important component of complex problem solving and supporting students in understanding the why, not just the how, of mathematics. The professional development intervention consists of summer workshop focused on approximations of teaching practice, and coaching during the school year.  The coaching component includes face-to-face coaching and a video-based tool that allows teachers and coaches to engage with records of classroom interactions. The project expands the successful Bridging professional development work by adding four additional mathematical practices that relate to argumentation, adding the coaching component, collecting data on students' equitable participation in classroom discussions, and piloting an impact study to determine whether the professional development that includes coaching leads to improved mathematics teaching and learning, and the mechanisms by which that hypothesized improvement occurs.<br/><br/>The Bridging series of professional development projects are built on a theoretical framework that begins with providing teachers with opportunities to engage in meaningful mathematics teaching practices, identify teaching moves that would support students in learning those practices, and to try out those moves with other teachers in approximations of teaching practice. The outcomes of such activity are increased teacher knowledge that can be mobilized in the planning and enactment of lessons, and improved pedagogical moves in the classroom.  This in turn is likely to lead to increased student engagement and mathematics achievement.  In this award, Bridging adds cycles of coaching to support teachers in translating lessons learned from approximations of practice to the work in their classrooms with students, and to provide ongoing school-year support for implementation. The research components of the project focus on understanding the practice of the coaches, including the design and deployment of coaching training and coaching sessions, as it relates to teachers' abilities to foster stronger student engagement in mathematical practices. The project will recruit 25 teachers at middle schools with experienced mathematics coaches to participate, with teachers directed to select a single focus class for data collection.  Case studies will be pursued with six teachers and three coaches that represent diverse backgrounds, experiences, and levels of prior knowledge. Video records of coaching training and sessions will be collected and analyzed, along with lessons plans and teacher-enacted lessons, to determine the influence of the coaching on practice. The study will also investigate the ways in which teacher engagement in the professional developments leads to changes in teacher practice and student outcomes.  Video records of practice, written lesson plans, student work, and interviews will be collected and analyzed to determine the impact on teaching practice.  Teachers' mathematical knowledge for teaching will also be assessed at key points in the project to assess teacher learning, and student standardized assessment scores and performance assessment outcomes will be collected to assess student learning.  <br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

2002860.xml,Entropy and Phase Transformations in Stable Nanocrystalline Alloys,NSF,2020-08-15,2023-07-31,425518,"Non-Technical Summary<br/>Nanocrystalline alloys are next-generation materials that are composed of many very small crystal grains, adhered together at disordered ""grain boundaries"". These materials have a variety of exceptional properties like extreme strength and wear resistance. They are also beginning to transition from laboratory curiosities to widely-adopted engineering materials thanks to a critically enabling concept: the stabilization of their grain boundaries by adding alloying elements. Traditional alloy science ignores the effect of grain boundaries, but these cannot be ignored in nanocrystalline metals where they are so prominent. Therefore, new alloy science is needed for these materials, with a focus on integrating the interactions between grain boundaries and alloying additions. This project studies the alloy science of nanocrystalline materials, with a special focus on the effects of temperature and maintaining stability at high temperatures. The project uses computer simulations at the atomic scale to explore the stability of various alloys in nanostructured form, and identifies limits to the compositions and conditions under which nanocrystalline structures can be formed.  Experiments are conducted to make and test these new theoretical advances, and to produce the first prototype samples of new nanocrystalline alloys. These developments are expected to lead to a predictive scientific toolkit for the future design of new families of nanocrystalline alloys, for use in a wide array of applications ranging from electronics, to machine components, to 3D printing. The research in this project is carried out by undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students at MIT as part of their training in materials science. The project team also engages with industry scientists to focus the work on relevant materials and applications, and to align the research for impact through future technology transfer.<br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/>The intellectual merits of this research program center on resolving the role of entropy in nanostructured alloys. Specifically, the project is developing a full view of configurational and vibrational entropy on grain boundary segregation in polycrystals, through atomistic computations that can separate these two contributions in a system with a full polycrystalline spectrum of grain boundary sites. This information in turn enables a full analysis of the free energy competition between bulk phases and nanostructured states, including details like boundary structural transitions (or complexion transitions) and allotropic phase transformations in the bulk. The overarching goal of the project is to achieve sufficiently quantitative thermodynamic calculations to be able to predict alloy phase diagrams complete with equilibrium and metastable nanocrystalline structures, and then to provide experimental tests of those predictions. The broader impacts of this program comprise a variety of training, outreach and dissemination activities. Undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers are trained on topics at the intersection of classical materials science core concepts (alloy thermodynamics, phase equilibria) and new topics in nanoscience (nanostructure stabilization). The research results are published in the open literature and also disseminated widely to industry through the outreach activities of the PI. In particular, industrial interactions are used to guide the research efforts towards relevant materials and temperatures of interest for practical purposes, facilitating future technology transfer.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002909.xml,CAS: Environmental Degradation Pathways for Some Emerging Contaminants,NSF,2020-09-01,2023-08-31,545001,"With this award, the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry supports research by Professor Barbara Finlayson-Pitts and her group to address the environmental fate of emerging contaminants (EC), which are chemicals that are not commonly monitored but may become widely distributed in the environment. They can have adverse effects on human health and ecological systems. This class of compounds includes some pharmaceuticals, pesticides and munitions. Once in the environment, these compounds can undergo reactions that either make them less, or in some cases, more toxic.  Thus, understanding their fates once released is important for understanding the health and environmental risks as well as for guiding the future development of less harmful substitutes.  The research in the Finlayson-Pitts group is directed at understanding the fundamental processes that occur when certain classes of EC are exposed to sunlight or oxidants found in the atmosphere. This provides information on how fast they will react in air and the nature of the products formed that can be used to guide toxicology studies. The project provides research opportunities for a postdoctoral student as well as several undergraduate students. The PI also engages in a variety of outreach and training activities through the AirUCI Institute which she leads. <br/><br/>To accomplish these goals, a combination of experimental approaches is used to study compounds that contain amine, nitro and in some cases, alkene groups. Thin films of the EC on infrared transmitting crystals are irradiated, and the loss of the EC and formation of products are followed in real time. Alternatively, the thin films are monitored during exposure to gas phase ozone. The mixtures of unreacted EC and its reaction products are extracted into solution and analyzed by a variety of separation and mass spectrometry techniques. Kinetics modeling is applied to determine the contributions of reaction and diffusion that occur in the gas-solid reactions.  Model compounds for the EC are also exposed to ozone, a strong oxidant, in the gas phase. This provide insights into the factors that control the oxidation and to find differences between similar reactions in the gas versus the condensed phase. These data provide a fundamental understanding of some of the degradation pathways that are likely to be important when these compounds are released into the environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Limited knowledge exists about the interconnections between the Arctic’s changing environment and socioecological systems across the world.  The diverse but uneven effects of Arctic regime shifts on ecosystems and cultural systems highlights the need for research to better understand these Arctic-global interconnections. This project gathers scientists and researchers for two workshops to address how transformations in the Arctic may affect human well-being in global environments, in light of the rapid changes undergoing in the Arctic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the Arctic and global interconnections opens up new understandings of networked environmental effects and the various infrastructures through which its resources and representations are produced and circulated. As such, this research advances systems-level understanding of links between the Arctic’s rapidly changing environmental, social, and cultural systems with other regions and networks across the world. Scholars are invited to consider theory and methods for studying such interconnections through environmental, infrastructural, and social dimensions. The workshops emphasize the increasing complexity of physical infrastructures, especially energy infrastructures, and digital infrastructures in shaping knowledge of environmental transformation and mediating social adaptation to such change both within and beyond the Arctic.

2001559.xml,Collaborative Research: The Nonlinear Stochastic Dynamics of Micro and Nanomechanical Systems,NSF,2020-06-15,2024-05-31,321831,"Technology continues to make great strides at the nanoscale, resulting in unprecedented capabilities.  Currently, thermal fluctuations have not driven nano systems outside their linear regime where their dynamics are well understood.  However, as mechanical systems are made smaller for next-generation technologies, their performance is becoming limited by the random thermal movements of the molecules that make up the device and surrounding medium as the thermal fluctuations are becoming sufficient to drive the mechanical system into a nonlinear regime.  Developing an understanding of the fluctuations of nano mechanical systems in this nonlinear regime is the focus of this work.  Three-dimensional nanoprinting will be employed to create structures designed to study nonlinear behavior when driven by the temperature alone.  A theoretical understanding of the nonlinear behavior will be created by utilizing the fundamental relationship between the fluctuations and the dissipation present in the system.  Our findings will provide the insights necessary to realize the next generation of nanotechnology where performance is anticipated to be well beyond the current state-of-the art.<br/><br/>The stochastic dynamics of nanoscale systems are at the heart of many important phenomena.  Currently, there is a good understanding of stochastic dynamics when a mechanical system remains in the linear regime.  However, many important challenges remain in understanding nonlinear fluctuations of nanomechanical systems.  In order to build this understanding, state-of-the-art nanofabrication and measurement approaches, coupled with the development of analytical and numerical methods to describe and predict these dynamics, will be utilized.  A direct laser write system will be used to fabricate structures tailored to exhibit highly nonlinear stochastic dynamics when driven by temperature alone.  The nonlinear stochastic dynamics of structures constructed from soft polymeric materials will be experimentally studied using measurements from a heterodyne interferometer.  A physical understanding of the system dynamics will be built using the powerful fluctuation-dissipation theorem.  The dynamics will be probed perturbatively and a factorization approach will be used to create a deterministic approach to describe the dynamics of strongly nonlinear systems.  After developing an understanding of the nonlinear fluctuations of a single mode of oscillation, the coupling between the different modes of oscillation of a complex structure will be investigated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000053.xml,Bioreactor-based Manufacturing of Glioblastoma Organoids,NSF,2020-05-15,2024-04-30,373293,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the deadliest form of brain tumor. Patients typically survive only 12-15 months after their initial diagnosis. Therefore, new treatments for GBM are urgently needed. However, finding new therapies for GBM has been challenging, largely due to the lack of models that adequately mimic the patient’s condition, which is particularly important since the disease is highly heterogeneous. That is, tumors differ widely in their pathological features and respond differently to treatments.  To address these issues, this project will develop ""GBM organoids,"" which are three-dimension masses of cells that mimic the behavior of miniature GBM tumors.  These organoids will be manufactured using GBM stem cells (specialized GBM cells that give rise to all types of cells in a GBM tumor) derived directly from patients.  Cells will be positioned using 3D printers and cultured in bioreactors.  The potential long-term outcomes of such biomanufactured organoids are reduced reliance on animal models for cancer research and a framework for suggesting novel treatments for GBM patients in the future. This project will also provide research and educational opportunities to underrepresented minority undergraduate and graduate students. International opportunities are planned that integrate the research results into summer study-abroad courses in order to help prepare the next generation of more globally competent engineers.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop GBM (glioblastoma) organoids that retain three main features of GBM tumors: intertumoral heterogeneity (i.e., molecular subtypes), intratumoral heterogeneity (i.e., cells in the inner/necrotic core exhibiting very different characteristics to those at the tumor periphery), and cancer stem cells (CSCs).  The goal will be achieved by creating GBM organoids that are homogeneous in size but retain in vivo-like intratumoral heterogeneity by using GBM CSCs. The Research Plan, designed to demonstrate that the project’s bioreactor-cultured GBM organoids can recapitulate the innate tumor microenvironment, is organized under three aims, each motivated by a scientific hypothesis. The FIRST Aim is to reproducibly biomanufacture GBM organoids in bioreactors.  Subaims are to:  a) demonstrate that sublethal fluid shear improves homogenous production of GBM organoids and b) elucidate the role of shear-induced EpCAM (Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule)-positive EVs (extracellular vessels) in organoid production.  Results obtained will be used to test the hypothesis that sublethal shear stress in stirred-tanks leads to GBM organoid production via EpCAM-positive extracellular vesicles (EVs). The SECOND Aim is to produce GBM organoids with perivascular niche-like ECM (extracellular matrix) and microvessels.  Subaims are to: a) demonstrate that GSCs in hyaluronic acid (HA)-rich conditions generate CD31+microvessel-like cells within GBM organoids; b) generate GBM organoids with 3D-printed HA hydrogels; c) produce GBM organoids with co-cultured microvessels and d) demonstrate  that pathological features of PDX (Patient-derived xenograft) tissues are recapitulated in biomanufactured organoids.  Results obtained will be used to test the hypothesis that tumor tissue-like angiogenesis by GSCs occurs when organoids are >500 μm diameter.  The THIRD Aim is to profile the genetic composition and chemotherapy sensitivity of biomanufactured GBM organoids.  Subaims are to: a) profile the patient-specific genetic subtypes (proneural (PN), neural (N), classical (C), and mesenchymal (M)) of biomanufactured organoids and b) characterize organoids’ responses to chemotherapeutic drugs TMZ (temozolomide) and SAL(salinomycin).  Results obtained will be used to test the hypothesis that pathologically relevant organoids recapitulate the intratumoral and intertumoral diversity found in tumor tissues, and thus, can serve as better in vitro models for drug response.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the same time, the rapid growth of high-speed wireless network services presents an opportunity for future distributed learning involving a vast number of smart IoT devices. This project targets several technical challenges posed by the limited reliability of wireless connections and computational constraints of the edge nodes in distributed learning systems. Overcoming these challenges is vital to the plethora of computation, communication, and coordination tasks required by distributed machine learning at the network edge. Centered on developing innovative edge learning algorithms over wireless MAC channels under the constraints of computing, power, and bandwidth, this project can significantly impact wireless edge learning in a variety of IoT applications, ranging from transportation, safety, and agriculture, to energy efficiency, e-health, and smart infrastructure. The broader impact of this research will also come through many educational opportunities by providing opportunities in STEM to K-12, women, and underrepresented minority students.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project will develop an innovative network architecture for distributed learning over wireless multi-access channels. Specifically, the PIs will take a principled approach to develop an integrated wireless edge learning framework, using both gradient-based methods and also very recent advances in gradient-free, zero-order optimization, while taking into account the constraints in computing, power and bandwidth therein, in a holistic manner. The developed methods will be also extended to the setting of distributed online learning and reinforcement learning under wireless MAC. The PIs will focus on optimizing communication-efficient gradient sparsification based local updates that are communicated within the wireless network under bandwidth constraints; and each sender intelligently carries out transmission power allocation based on learning gradient and channel conditions. One important objective is to develop a novel learning-based framework for efficient wireless channel estimation and update to enable effective power control and learning. The project will devise edge learning algorithms that are robust against wireless channel uncertainty. The team of PIs shall comprehensively investigate the impact of the wireless bandwidth and power constraint on both the accuracy and convergence speed of edge learning algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002570.xml,EAGER: Fundamentals of Modeling and Control for the Evolving Electric Power System Architectures,NSF,2020-02-01,2023-05-31,250000,"The main objective of this project is to formalize ground-breaking general principles in support of investment planning and operating protocols for the changing electric energy systems.  Having this is crucial for assessing effects of candidate hardware and software technologies and for creating an environment in which flexible technologies are utilized by complementing each other’s performance and by jointly meeting the societal needs. Since the performance of many technologies of interest greatly depends on how well they are integrated over time and stakeholders (system modules), an effective framework needs to support decisions that are data-enabled and interactive over time and among different system decision makers. In this project a complex dynamical systems point of view is taken which recognizes such distributed nature of decisions and introduces novel modeling, control and protocol principles in support of system integration in time and space. In sharp contrast with the lack of theoretically-provable performance in the evolving electric power system architectures, this project explores fundamentals and takes major steps toward solving this long-overdue problem. The most important impact will be on the way electric power industry architectures evolve. In particular, the project will catalyze the adoption of data-enabled decision making and automation. Notably, this approach will help educate students to think about emerging electric energy systems as complex dynamical systems for which much innovation is needed and possible. Results of this research will be disseminated through a workshop on design and control of complex energy systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The next generation Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) can evolve based on protocols defined according to a dynamic monitoring, and decision system (DyMonDS) framework envisioned in this project. Such framework is crucial for assessing effects of candidate hardware and software technologies and for creating an environment in which technologies are integrated and utilized by complementing each other’s performance and by jointly meeting the societal needs. In this project a complex dynamical systems point of view is taken which recognizes such distributed nature of decisions and introduces novel modeling, control and protocol principles in support of temporal and spatial system integration. The main question is how to ensure stability and efficiency of these systems without increasing complexity of information management and consequent implications on cyber-security. Once principles for answering this complex question are formalized, it becomes possible to support selection of “right” technologies and for utilizing them based on data obtained through sensing, communications and control.  To establish such principles and not radically change the industry, this project introduces a generalization of today’s Automatic Generation Control by the Balancing Authorities (BAs) which is fundamentally cooperative in nature.  The interactions between BAs are managed by each area compensating its own Area Control Error (ACE) which is the net power imbalance contributed by both internal power deviations from schedules and by the tie-line flow deviations into the BA. This is a great example of distributed control through cooperation based on simple protocols of balancing ACE.  In this project the ACE is generalized into a notion of an interaction variable (intVar) associated with each intelligent Balancing Authority (iBA). Notably, an intVar has a physical interpretation in terms of power and rate of change of power, but it is not restricted to the assumptions made by the industry today, and it allows for different unconventional architectures, such as small iBAs nested within the existing BAs.  iBAs can be components or subsystems of diverse spatial and temporal granularity, and are technology agnostic; their specifications, modeling and interactive multi-layered control are in terms of an intVar common to all. This project targets specifically principles for protocols and enhanced standards for a general DyMonDS framework so that following this framework one can catalyze performance enhancements based on the PI’s recent finding that the intVar dynamics can be interpreted in terms of rates of exergy (potential to perform useful work) and anergy (wasted work).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001145.xml,Collaborative Research: Lithosphere-scale anisotropic imaging across the Eastern North American Margin's ocean-continent transition,NSF,2019-08-16,2024-07-31,115472,"The cycle of continent formation and subsequent breakup to build oceans is an essential aspect of plate tectonics and is one of the fundamental processes that shape the planet. Yet, there are several details of continental rifting that continue to elude us. Rifted margins, such as that which comprises the entire east coast of the United States, represent the contact between continental crust and oceanic crust that is formed during, and after, the breakup (in this case, the Atlantic Ocean formed as Africa moved away). These margins retain a record of the processes that led up to, coincided with, and followed continental breakup. This project will utilize existing onshore and offshore seismic data to study in detail the deformation that produced the modern day eastern U.S. The results will aid in assessing contemporary hazard and risks along the margin. This project supports the training of a graduate student at the University of California at Santa Barbara and at least one undergraduate student at the University of Arizona. It also supports outreach activities to several high schools in North Carolina that hosted seismic instruments that recorded earthquake data used in the analyses.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to shed light on two fundamental scientific questions related to the structure, evolution, and on-going dynamics associated with the eastern North American passive rift margin (ENAM): 1) What is the structure of the lithosphere from top to bottom across the ocean-continent transition and how was it shaped by rifting processes? 2) What is the history of deformation both within and seaward of the passive margin, and how is present-day mantle flow controlled by the margin's structure? Depth-constrained 3-D anisotropic velocity models will be produced of the ENAM from crust to below the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB). By employing different imaging techniques in sequence, we will create a suite of complementary models: a) 3-D isotropic shear velocity model from inversion of ambient noise and earthquake-generated surface waves; b) 1-D high-resolution velocity profiles using dispersion curves inverted jointly with S-p and P-s receiver functions sensitive to crust and mantle discontinuities; c) 3-D finite-frequency body-wave azimuthal anisotropy tomography using the surface wave tomography as a starting model. These models will be jointly interpreted to refine estimates of crustal thickness and LAB character across the margin in the context of geodynamical rifting models, as well as to understand deformational flow during rifting and margin maturation to the present day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, they are using advanced simulations to obtain a molecular-level understanding of chromatographic separation processes. “Separation science plays a critical role in maintaining our standard of living and quality of life,” as recently emphasized by the National Academies in a report entitled ""A Research Agenda for Transforming Separation Science."" Chromatography is an important approach to separations that exploits differences in the interactions of various chemicals with particles packed into a tube (a chromatographic column). Small differences in these interactions get magnified as the mixture passes through the chromatographic column enabling one compound to move more quickly through the column than another and thus, separate. This university-industry team is working to improve understanding of how modifications of the particle surfaces and the use of environmentally benign solvents impact the separation, thereby enabling improved chemical separation systems. This partnership is advancing the education and training of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students, with special efforts made to recruit students from traditionally underrepresented groups in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.  This effort has relevance to advanced manufacturing as separations is one of the most expensive and time-consuming aspects of the production of industrial scale chemicals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The underlying principles of liquid and supercritical fluid chromatography are inherently complex, being dictated by the interplay of the sample with the stationary phase (porous solid substrate and bonded ligands) and the mobile phase (often a mixture of solvents). The Siepmann group and Kroungold Analytical are using Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations with enhanced-sampling algorithms and transferable molecular-mechanics force fields to model and characterize interactions in hydrophilic stationary phases including zwitterionic phases; novel hydrophobic stationary phases with limited flexibility and wettability tuned by the addition of hydrophilic compounds; and supercritical carbon dioxide and hot, compressed water mobile phases. The team is also utilizing coarse-grained models to investigate retention of block copolymers in superficially porous particles. Advanced Materials Technology is leading an effort to carry out synergistic chromatographic measurements. The development of both stationary phases with improved retention characteristics and sustainable mobile phases is being advanced through the molecular-level insights derived from this work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conference is aimed at early-career mathematicians (especially graduate students) and is to be held September 7-12, 2020, at the Centro Internacional de Encuentros Matematicos (CIEM) in Castro Urdiales, Spain. The summer school is primarily for the purpose of training young researchers and encouraging their mastery of the subject area.  It will begin with three days of introductory lectures, followed by three days of more advanced lectures introducing the students to some current hot topics in the mathematical area of representation theory. The conference has three organizers and five speakers, representing a total of six countries. Hence, by allowing U.S.-based students to attend the summer school, this grant will stimulate important international collaboration and networking in the area.   Women and members of other groups underrepresented in mathematics are especially encouraged to participate, as building a network of peers early in one's research career has been shown to be especially crucial for staying active and visible in the field.<br/> <br/>The summer school will encourage cross-pollination between the two related (but sometimes seemingly distant) fields of character theory and module theory.  Many of the recent advances and open conjectures in the area of representation theory have made it clear that there is a strong benefit to combining the techniques from both sides.  The introductory lectures are designed for graduate students and postdocs with a good background in algebra but no prior knowledge in representation theory. They will cover the general theory from two different points of view: one focusing on the more numerical, character-theoretic point of view, and the other on the homological, module-theoretic point of view.  These courses will have a strong focus on arriving at some of the key definitions and concepts in block theory. The second part of the summer school will be aimed at showing the students some of the current directions of representation theory and how both perspectives play a role in some of the fundamental conjectures in the area.  Throughout the summer school, lectures will be alternated with discussion and problem sessions led by the speakers and organizers.  By providing students with an intensive introductory series of courses and lectures on current hot topics in the area, the summer school aims to motivate young researchers to use their talents to advance the state of knowledge in the area and to inspire a new generation of well-rounded representation theorists.

The research centers on the theme of symbolic powers, an active topic of research with connections to virtually all aspects of commutative algebra. This project aims to resolve two questions, on comparing the geometric notion of symbolic powers with the algebraic notion of natural powers, and on the application of the differential algebraic notion of p-derivations to commutative algebra. The investigator will direct undergraduate research experiences and organize a graduate workshop in commutative algebra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unifying theme of this project is the study of symbolic powers of ideals. The research focuses primarily on two questions: the containment problem and applications of p-derivations to commutative algebra. While ideals in a polynomial ring correspond to the polynomials that vanish on a certain variety in affine space, their symbolic powers consist of the polynomials that vanish to a certain order on the given variety. This natural geometric notion has an algebraic description coming from the theory of primary decomposition, an ideal-theoretic version of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. This is an old, rich, and ubiquitous topic, yet there is an abundance of questions about symbolic powers that are both easy to phrase and very difficult to solve. The containment problem attempts to compare symbolic powers, a natural geometric notion, with ordinary powers, a natural algebraic notion. This relates to other interesting questions, such as determining the minimal degrees of polynomials vanishing on a given variety. Another part of the project is to discover new connections between p-derivations and commutative algebra, with an eye towards a new singularity theory in mixed characteristic that combines p-derivations with differential operators in the spirit of the theory of F-singularities and its connections to D-modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001318.xml,Tensor Categories and Representations of Quantized Algebras,NSF,2020-09-01,2025-08-31,533380,"Representation theory is a study of symmetries of space, such as our 3-dimensional space, or, more generally, a space with any (even infinite number) of dimensions. In this theory, symmetries are represented by linear transformations of this space, or, more explicitly, by matrices. Thus, a representation of a given symmetry structure is basically a collection of matrices which satisfy a certain natural system of nonlinear equations. The equations are determined by the exact type of symmetry structure we are representing - a group, a Lie algebra, or an associative algebra. Representations of a given structure themselves form a quite intricate and rich structure, which encodes relations (or mappings) between different representations. This higher-level structure is called the category of representations. For some type of structures (e.g. for groups, Lie algebras, quantum groups), representations can be multiplied; in this case the corresponding categories are tensor categories (as multiplication of representations is similar to multiplication of tensors). It turns out that the notion of a tensor category is very interesting in its own right, and that many tensor categories don't arise as categories of representations. The PI will investigate ordinary and tensor categories, some of which arise as representation categories and some of which don't, as well as the connections between them. In particular, complex rank generalizations of representation categories proposed by P. Deligne will be investigated. Roughly speaking, this is a generalization in which the number of elements of a set or rows of a matrix is allowed to be non-integer. This seemingly nonsensical setting becomes meaningful and useful when the invariants one is interested in turn out to be polynomials of the number of elements or rows, which is often true. The PI will also investigate quantizations of singular symplectic varieties, for instance symplectic resolutions. These are non-commutative algebras that appear in certain kinds of quantum field theories of recent interest as algebras of quantum observables. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves research on: tensor categories; quantum groups; representation theory in complex rank; cherednik algebras; short star-products on quantizations; analytic approach to Geometric Langlands program. The plan of PI's work is as follows. 1. Develop a theory of Frobenius functors for symmetric tensor categories in characteristic p and Frobenius exact &lt;br/&gt;categories; classify exact factorizations of fusion categories, in particular twisted Deligne products; classify fiber functors and module categories over the representation category of the small quantum group; compute the semisimplification of the category of tilting modules for a reductive group in small characteristic, and use it to compute the dimensions of tilting modules modulo p; prove quasi-motivicity of representations of braid groups arising from braided fusion categories; construct new symmetric tensor categories in characteristic p&gt;2 similar to the Etingof-Benson categories in characteristic 2; compute cohomology of these categories; develop Lie theory in the Verlinde category; develop a theory of symplectic reflection fusion categories; continue to develop the theory of actions of finite dimensional Hopf algebras on division algebras (in particular, fields); classify unipotent tensor categories. Work on a discrete analog of the monodromy theorem of Toledano Laredo for the Casimir connection, using dynamical Weyl groups, Study signatures of representations of quantum groups for |q|=1. 2. Continue to develop the ideas of P. Deligne, and extend representation theories of various classical structures (containing the symmetric group S_n or classical Lie groups GL(n),O(n),Sp(2n)) to complex values of the rank parameter n. These structures will include degenerate affine Hecke algebras, rational and trigonometric Cherednik algebras, symplectic reflection algebras, real reductive Lie groups (i.e., symmetric pairs), Lie superalgebras, affine Lie algebras, (parabolic) category O for reductive Lie algebras, Yangians, and other structures. Compute reducibility loci and obtain various character formulas and signature formulas in these representation theories, and answer various other representation theoretic questions which are known to be interesting in the classical setting. 3. Work on the representation theory of double Yangians, the theory of elliptic algebras, representations of cyclotomic Cherednik algebras, signatures of representations of Cherednik algebras, representations of Cherednik algebras in positive characteristic, direct and inverse image functors for Cherednik algebras. 4. Continue to develop the theory of short star-products on filtered quantizations. 5. Continue to work with E. Frenkel and D. Kazhdan on an analytic approach to the geometric Langlands correspondence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project addresses this ?power wall? challenge from the system software aspect by developing application-aware methodologies of energy modeling and power management. The project optimizes system efficiency by tuning performance and energy consumption to resonate with application runtime behavior while staying below the system power envelope. The project develops user interfaces and new compiler models and runtime tuning techniques to manage the tradeoffs between performance and energy consumption. The approach enables cooperative, application-specific control of energy consumption between hardware, system software and applications. The investigations and solutions deepen understanding of application power usage and guide users to customized performance and energy consumption behavior.<br/><br/>This collaborative project integrates the development, education, and outreach efforts of collaborating University partners and is well positioned to have a substantial impact on both the HPC research community and hardware designers and vendors. All findings are published in peer-reviewed conferences and journals while source code and results are available through a project web site. This work addresses the need for energy efficiency improvements in large-scale systems in support of high-end simulations used to design pharmaceuticals, aircraft, global warming scenarios, etc. The proposed techniques influence the design of future directions HPC and enterprise computing systems from industry and government. The project engages and trains graduate and undergraduate students, including underrepresented minority students, in the area of energy efficient computing, parallel and high performance computing, and computer architecture and systems.

2001752.xml,Collaborative Research: SI2-SSI: Expanding Volunteer Computing,NSF,2019-09-01,2021-04-30,172474,"Volunteer computing (VC) uses donated computing time consumer devices such as home computers and smartphones to do scientific computing. It has been shown that VC can provide greater computing power, at lower cost, than conventional approaches such as organizational computing centers and commercial clouds. BOINC is the most common software framework for VC. Essentially, donors of computing time simply have to load BOINC on their computer or smartphone, and then register to donate at the BOINC web site. VC provides ""high throughput computing"": handling lots of independent jobs, with performance goals based on the rate of job completion rather than completion time for individual jobs. This type of computing (all known as high-throughput computing) is in great demand in most areas of science. Until now, the adoption of VC has been limited by its structure. For example, VC projects (such as Einstein@home and Rosetta@home) are operated by individual research groups, and volunteers must browse and choose from among many such projects. As a result, there are relatively few VC projects, and volunteers are mostly tech-savvy computer enthusiasts.  This project aims to solve these problems using two complementary development efforts: First, it will add BOINC-based VC conduits to two major high-performance computing providers: (a) the Texas Advanced Computing Center, a supercomputer center, and (b) nanoHUB, a web portal for nano science that provides computing capabilities.Also, a unified control interface to VC will be developed, tentatively called Science United, where donors can register.  The project  will benefit thousands of scientists who use these facilities, and it will create technology that makes it easy for other HPC providers to add their own VC back ends. Also, Science United will provide a simpler interface to BOINC volunteers where they will register to support scientific areas, rather than specific projects. Science United will also serve as an allocator of computing power among projects. Thus, new projects will no longer have to do their own marketing and publicity to recruit volunteers. Finally, the creation of a single VC ""brand"" (i.e Science United) will allow coherent marketing of VC to the public. By creating a huge pool of low-cost computing power that will benefit thousands of scientists, and increasing public awareness of and interest in science, the project plans to establish VC as a central and long-term part of the U.S. scientific cyber infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adding VC to an existing HPC facility involves several technical issues, which will be addressed as follows: (1) Packaging science applications (which typically run on Linux cluster nodes) to run on home computers (mostly Windows, some Mac and Linux): the team is developing an approach using VirtualBox and Docker, in which the application and its environment (Linux distribution, libraries, executables) are represented as a set of layers comprising a Docker image, which is then run as a container within a Linux virtual machine on the volunteer device. This has numerous advantages: it reduces the work of packaging applications to near zero; it minimizes network traffic because a given Docker layer is downloaded to a host only once; and it provides a strong security sandbox so that volunteer computers are protected from buggy or malicious applications, (2) File management: Input and output files must be moved between existing private servers and public-facing servers that are accessible to the outside Internet. A file management system will be developed, based on Web RPCs, for this purpose. This system will use content-based naming so that a given file is transferred and stored only once. It also maintains job/file associations so that files can be automatically deleted from the public server when they are no longer needed. (3) Submitting and monitoring jobs:  BOINC provides a web interface for efficiently submitting and monitoring large batches of jobs. These were originally developed as part of a system to migrate HTCondor jobs to BOINC. This project is extending it to support the additional requirements of TACC and nanoHUB. Note that these new capabilities are not specific to TACC or nanoHUB: they provide the glue needed to easily add BOINC-based VC to any existing HTC facility. The team is also developing RPC bindings in several languages (Python, C++, PHP). The other component of the project, Science United, is a database-driven web site and an associated web service for the BOINC clients. Science United will control volunteer hosts (i.e. tell them which projects to work for) using BOINC's ""Account Manager"" mechanism, in which the BOINC client on each host periodically contacts Science United and is told what projects to run. Project servers, not Science United, will distribute jobs and files. Science United will define a set of ""keywords"" for science areas (physics, biomedicine, environment, etc.) and for location (country, institution). Projects will be labelled with appropriate keywords. Volunteers will have a yes/no/maybe interface for specifying the types of jobs they want to run. Science United will thus provide a mechanism in which a fraction of total computing capacity can be allocated to a project for a given period. Because total capacity changes slowly over time, this allows near-certain guaranteed allocations. Science United will embody a scheduling system that attempts to enforce allocations, honor volunteer preferences, and maximize throughput. Finally, Science United will do detailed accounting of computing. Volunteer hosts will tell Science United how much work (measured by CPU time and FLOPs, GPU time and FLOPs, and number of jobs) they have done for each project. Science United will maintain historical records of this data for volunteers and projects, and current totals with finer granularity (e.g. for each host/project combination). Finally, Science United will provide web interfaces letting volunteers see their contribution status and history, and letting administrators add projects, control allocations, and view accounting data."

The former seeks to understand the shapes they define, and the latter seeks to understand the set of (say) integer or rational solutions to the system. One of the most important themes of 21st century mathematics is the interplay between these two viewpoints: the properties of the shape in question influence, and are in turn influenced by, the arithmetic of the equations. This project seeks to understand this fundamental interplay through a study of the arithmetic of fundamental groups of algebraic varieties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this project is concerned with (1) an analysis of the representation theory of arithmetic fundamental groups, taking as input the geometric Langlands program, tools from p-adic analysis, and p-adic Hodge theory, and (2) an application of these results to concrete problems in arithmetic and algebraic geometry: for example, the geometric torsion conjecture, the non-abelian Chabauty-Kim method, and the section conjecture.

Reasoning patterns refer to various ways of student thinking when making sense of a natural phenomenon or trying to solve a problem. The investigators will conduct a proof of concept study to develop automated diagnostics that can identify middle-school students’ reasoning patterns based on their written responses to assessments of their understanding of concepts in ecology. With the states increasingly moving towards implementing assessments aligned to the NGSS, feedback based on individual students’ reasoning patterns would allow teachers the ability to develop more individualized feedback and would also support the design of automated instruction based on evidence of what students know and how they learn, rather than instruction based simply on whether they had answered correctly or not. The project is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning. <br/><br/>The investigators will conduct a proof of concept study to identity student reasoning patterns for making sense of ecosystems by investigating student responses to constructed test items collected from an NGSS-aligned assessment database. In the first stage of the study, the investigators will use a 3-dimensional (content knowledge, procedural knowledge, and epistemic knowledge) approach to assessment that aligns with the NGSS. They will leverage cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify student reasoning patterns, attempting to label text as data description and system relationship description and attempting to identify superficial integration as opposed to integrated reasoning. The investigators will engage in an iterative process to compare the classification produced by the automated tools with that produced by human scorers. With this classification developed and validated, the investigators will have demonstrated the feasibility of later attempting to develop an NLP-based automated system that could provide immediate feedback to students, identifying weaknesses in reasoning rather than only whether an answer was correct, and to teachers, allowing them to tailor instruction to individual students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will do so by conducting basic research on how the intuitive thinking of biology students helps and/or hinders their learning of biological concepts in STEM learning environments. The project focuses on anthropocentric thinking, a particular kind of intuitive thinking that anchors understanding of the biological world in human terms. Anthropocentric thinking results in a tendency to see humans as biologically exceptional or to reason about other organisms by analogy to humans. Previous NSF-sponsored findings show that anthropocentric thinking may have a complex role in how undergraduates learn biological science. This project intends to examine this issue from three perspectives:  1) How students from different backgrounds may vary in the degree to which they bring with anthropocentric conceptions to the biology classroom. 2) How teaching biology concepts using anthropocentric language might help and/or hinder student learning. 3) How faculty may intentionally or unintentionally use anthropocentric language in their own teaching. This research has the potential to contribute to the NSF EHR mission by discovering how specific systems of cognitive understanding may interact with formal classroom teaching to help and/or hinder science learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will leverage a successful long-term collaboration between cognitive scientists and discipline-based education researchers to investigate the educational consequences of intuitive understandings. These investigators’ previous work revealed systematic relationships between patterns of intuitive, informal thought about biology, including teleological, essentialist, and anthropocentric thinking, as well as revealing misconceptions about biological concepts among students. It showed anthropocentric thinking is more strongly and consistently related to biological misconceptions than other types of intuitive thinking.  However, widespread and frequent use of anthropocentric language by biology faculty in classrooms suggests that at least some instructors see pedagogical merit in such thinking. Moreover, although this project's researchers have found similar anthropocentric thinking and misconceptions among students in two different urban institutions, anthropocentric thinking has been shown to be reduced among people from rural backgrounds. Therefore, this project intends to probe relationships between anthropocentric thinking and biological misconceptions among students from rural backgrounds. It is important to explore in depth the ways in which anthropocentric framing may facilitate learning formal biology concepts (via human examples and analogies) and/or engender misconceptions (via human exceptionalism). Accordingly, the project aims to investigate the effects of anthropocentric framing on biology learning by experimentally presenting biology concepts framed in different ways and assessing resulting learning and misconceptions. Finally, although there is widespread evidence of anthropocentric language in faculty lectures, the degree to which instructors consciously employ such language as a pedagogical strategy is unknown. Therefore, this project seeks to assess faculty metacognitive awareness of their use of anthropocentric language in biology explanations. Results of this research are expected to inform the building of an important and generative theoretical framework integrating disconnected yet theoretically interdependent lines of inquiry in cognitive science and discipline-based science education research. It has the potential to translate this theoretical framework for understanding the acquisition of expertise in life sciences into pedagogical best practices and thus influence the way undergraduate biology is taught. The proposed project is a joint effort between the Conceptual Organization, Reasoning, and Education Laboratory (CORE Lab) at Northeastern University and the Science Education Partnership and Assessment Laboratory (SEPAL) at San Francisco State University, and is supported by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002231.xml,Molecular mechanisms of heterochromatin spreading at the leading edge,NSF,2020-03-01,2025-02-28,948966,"Molecular mechanisms of heterochromatin spreading at the leading edge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will uncover molecular details of how genes are stably turned off to produce different types of cells.  Stable gene silencing can distinguish single-celled organisms and it also helps the human body use the same genome to create very different cell types that form organs.  One major determinant of stable gene silencing is how far along a chromosome the wave of silencing spreads.  Understanding how spreading occurs and how it is stopped are the primary focuses of this project.  Achieving the goals of this project will help us understand variation across genetically identical cells that underlies development and environmental effects on gene regulation.   The project will be undertaken by a team of scientists lead by the PI and including postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduates.  Summer research experiences for high school students and their teachers from a local school with a high minority population will enhance the training impact of the project.  Together, the team will contribute to the research, combining their resources and skill sets while mentoring each other across levels.  The results from this project will be broadly shared with the research community and the public and the resources generated will be made available to the scientific field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heterochromatin is a genomic structure that represses transcription in a manner that is epigenetically maintained through cell division, contributing to stable cell differentiation in all eukaryotes.  Establishment of a heterochromatin domain involves site-specific initiation and subsequent spreading across large regions of the genome, incorporating repressor proteins that stably associate with chromatin.  Spreading is coupled to the conversion of histone modifications at the “leading edge” and eventual transition to the stable heterochromatin state.  This mechanism requires two main modes of action for the heterochromatin machinery: dynamic spreading and stable repressive association with chromatin.  While much is known of the components of heterochromatin in multiple systems, we do not understand at molecular resolution how the machinery coordinates the transitions through the steps of the mechanism.  This project harnesses a purified budding yeast heterochromatin system that fully recapitulates the dynamic conversion of histone modifications and the formation of a stable repressive heterochromatin state.  Previous work from the research group using this system has generated models for many steps in the mechanism that will now be tested at a new level of molecular resolution.  Advanced cross-linking mass spectrometry will be used, combined with “designer” chromatin to capture the heterochromatin machinery in the multiple modes of action that drive formation of an epigenetic repressive genomic structure.  The wealth of genetic and biochemical tools available will allow for identification of the most important molecular interactions for heterochromatin assembly, generating a new level of mechanistic understanding of this fundamental genomic regulatory system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To meet the growing biotechnology workforce needs, the National Center for Biotechnology Workforce at Forsyth Technical Community College has been supporting nationwide education and training of technicians in biotechnology, bioprocessing, and related programs at community colleges. Biotechnology industries increasingly need workers with hands-on training in high-resolution mass spectrometry.   This project aims to expand the breadth and relevance of its support for biotechnology technician education by acquiring a high-resolution mass spectrometer. This state-of-the-art analytical tool can identify specific chemicals in a sample, even when the sample contains only a trillionth of a gram of that chemical.  Such information is used in industries ranging from environmental testing, and food and beverage production, to drug discovery and manufacturing.  The project proposes to use this spectrometer to train students and faculty in state-of-the art high-resolution mass spectrometry technology, thus aligning  technician education with emerging workforce needs.<br/><br/>The project has two goals.  First, it plans to acquire a high-resolution mass spectrometer and collaborate with industry partners to use real-world bioscience projects to provide students with skills-based instruction in how to use this technology.  Second, it plans to provide workshops that will help high school STEM educators increase their understanding of the bioscience industry, including the use of high-resolution mass spectrometry. These workshops are intended to provide teachers with the knowledge and skills they need to guide students into community college technician education programs that lead to bioscience careers. The College will partner with educators, employers, and entrepreneurs in and around Innovation Quarter in downtown Winston-Salem, NC, to develop instructional labs using high-resolution mass spectrometry on industry-related projects. Labs will include standard operating procedures on how to use the instrument to collect high-resolution mass spectrometry data, as well as how to interpret these data. This skills-based learning will serve faculty and students from the College and high school STEM programs, as well as those at other local universities. The workshops will also serve educators from across the nation who will be selected for their interest in and potential to develop advanced skills training that connects their local industry with the classroom.

But in order to make sound decisions, understanding how large the most severe events are likely to be is imperative. The PI will focus on developing statistical tools for understanding the spatial structure of the most extreme events. These new tools will improve on existing models because they will be both more realistic and more computationally tractable.  The PI will also apply these tools to help scientists and policymakers study risks posed by severe environmental phenomena like inland floods, wildfires, and coastal storm surges. Furthermore, the PI will organize workshops to foster closer integration of statistical and Earth science research, as well as develop graduate courses and a textbook focused on modern statistical methods for Earth science.<br/><br/>The PI will develop stochastic models for extreme events in space that are 1) flexible enough to transition across different classes of extremal dependence, and 2) permit inference through likelihood functions that can be computed for large datasets.  It will accomplish these modeling goals by representing stochastic dependence relationships conditionally, which will induce desirable tail dependence properties and allow efficient inference through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The first research component will develop sub-asymptotic models for spatial extremes using max-infinitely divisible (max-id) processes, a generalization of the limiting max-stable class of processes, based on a conditional representation.  The second research component will develop sub-asymptotic spatial models for extremes based on scale mixtures of spatial Gaussian processes.  The PI will conduct closely interwoven computational development and theoretical explication of the joint tail dependence that the proposed hierarchically specified max-id and scale mixture processes induce.  Finally, the PI will apply these models to problems of high societal impact, such as extreme precipitation risk, wildfire susceptibility, and coastal storm surge exposure.  The PI will enhance connections between extreme value statisticians and communities of climate and atmospheric scientists, mitigation researchers, and stakeholders, through 1) biannual international workshops on weather and climate extremes, 2)  a Ph.D. level course in spatial statistics which will include new advances and applications of spatial extremes, and 3) writing the textbook Modern Statistics for Earth Scientists.  The PI also will add modules on extremes to Penn State's Sustainable Climate Risk Management (SCRiM) summer school, and contribute to SCRiM's electronic resources and interactive teaching materials for educators, decision makers, underrepresented groups, and the general public.  The PI will strengthen existing collaborations with government agencies which are responsible for communicating and mitigating risk to the public posed by extremal environment phenomena.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These remarkable self-propelled materials can convert chemical or light energy into locomotion, increasing mixing and accelerating chemical reactions. Asymmetry in particle composition enables movement through a local build-up of reaction products, whereas particle size and geometry control speed and directionality. While motors with dimensions of 100s of nanometers or microns have been widely studied, sub-100 nm devices have been largely neglected because they are harder to make. This research will use the expert manufacturing capabilities of viral biomaterials to overcome these fabrication challenges. The development of such an assembly strategy will enable the spatial and topographical control essential for important biomedical, sensing, and environmental remediation applications. This research will support both mentoring and outreach activities to inspire, recruit, and train a diverse group of scientists and engineers. These activities will strengthen the education of graduate, undergraduate, and middle students.<br/><br/>Technical Summary: <br/><br/>Viral nanoparticles are monodisperse, self-assembled biomaterials.  Their structure and chemistry, including exact shape and site-specific functional groups, is genetically encoded and known with precision.  The project objective is to create a shape-changing viral template with broken symmetry that is capable of serving as a platform with which to design and synthesize asymmetric functional nanomaterials. The proposed work will focus on using the size and shape of the transformed viral templates to manipulate the motion of viral nanoparticle-based nanoswimmers.  Viral geometry will be converted from filament to rod to spheroid through brief organic solvent exposure. Following these extreme dimensional changes and sidechain packing transitions, differences in surface exposed residues will be evaluated.  In addition, the effect of N-terminal amino acid sidechain character on solvent-based transformation, as well as the size and stability of the shape-modified scaffold will be studied.  The reduced surface chemistry homogeneity of the shape-changed viruses will be used to synthesize or assemble non-centrosymmetric self-electrophoretic and light-induced self-electrophoretic nanoparticle-based nanoswimmers. Viral-templated nanoparticle trajectory will be explored, rotational and translational diffusion coefficients measured, and motion correlated with nanomaterial size and shape. The proposed studies will improve fundamental understanding of the structure-function relationship associated with geometric tunability of the filamentous virus and particle motion; advance knowledge of biomolecule interactions with and control over non-centrosymmetric nanostructure formation; and enhance viral-templated nanoparticle motion through precise control over template size and shape.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001293.xml,"Automorphic Forms, Arthur Packets, and Algebraic Cycles",NSF,2020-07-01,2025-06-30,360000,"A classical question in number theory is to find solutions in rational numbers or integers to systems of polynomial equations. In the twentieth century, mathematicians realized that this question can be reformulated using geometric objects called algebraic cycles. This realization gave rise to a vast and beautiful conjectural framework, which now includes some of the most important unresolved conjectures in mathematics. On the other hand, the discovery of the law of quadratic reciprocity (due to Gauss) and its generalizations lead ultimately to the formulation of the Langlands program, which is a separate web of conjectures relating the symmetries of numbers to analysis and group theory. The questions to be studied in this project lie at the interface of these two different webs of conjectures, and thus involve objects of enormous arithmetic richness. The specific goal of the project is to use the study of certain highly symmetric functions to reveal information about the geometry and arithmetic of polynomial equations. While the final goal is to reveal sophisticated information about polynomials, many of the objects to be studied have immediate practical applications. For example, elliptic curves, which are cubic equations in two variables, play a prominent role in this research and also an important role in contemporary applications such as cryptography and digital signatures, which have extensive use in commerce. One of the broader impacts of the project will be the development of a course on the mathematics of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, popularizing mathematics through an exciting application of broad current popular interest. The project will also provide research training activities for graduate students<br/><br/>In technical terms, the main thrust of the research is to use the fine structure of automorphic representations, including the theory of local and global Arthur packets, to study problems on algebraic cycles. Specific problems to be studied include: (i) constructing Hodge cycles that represent instances of Langlands functoriality, especially for unitary groups; (ii) Oda's conjecture on the factorization of Hodge structures of Hilbert modular forms; (iii) relations between Abel-Jacobi images of cohomologically trivial cycles and p-adic L-functions; (iv) integral period relations for quaternionic modular forms, and (v) applications of the theory of non-tempered A-packets to generalizations of Kudla-Millson theory on locally symmetric spaces.

The particular class of fully nonlinear elliptic equations and systems is especially important from this perspective. For instance, such equations and systems play a role in the theoretical study of composite materials. This project will contribute to a basic understanding of fully nonlinear elliptic equations and systems, thereby providing scientists and engineers with sharpened insight into various physical processes and ultimately enhancing the quality of consumer products manufactured from composites. As part of the project, the principal investigator will train Ph.D. students, many of whom are expected to continue their careers as educators and help convey the long-term value of mathematical research not only to science and engineering but also, in the end, to society.<br/> <br/>At a technical level, this project is a natural continuation of the principal investigator's earlier work, which includes valuable contributions to this research area. One part of the project concerns a longstanding open problem on the existence and compactness of solutions to a fully nonlinear Yamabe problem. This is equivalent to solving, on a Riemannian manifold, a fully nonlinear elliptic, but not uniformly elliptic, partial differential equation of second order. The current understanding of this type of equations is insufficient, especially compared to what is known for fully nonlinear uniformly elliptic second order equations, where theories are much more mature. The study of this open problem should lead to a better understanding of these elliptic, but not uniformly elliptic, equations. It will also lead to a better understanding of degenerate elliptic fully nonlinear equations of second order. This project will provide new analytical tools for the study of these and other important nonlinear partial differential equations arising from geometry and physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Financial and logistical burdens related to debris removal account for nearly a third of reimbursed recovery costs, and threats to public safety range from impaired emergency response to health hazards. There is need for more accurate models to estimate debris presence and quantities after, and preferably prior to a storm, so communities can better prepare for and manage debris burdens. Knowledge about what drives debris patterns is limited, so current predictive models are not accurate enough to support planning or response, particularly for multi-hazard storm events. In addition, coastal landscapes are constantly changing, and as development patterns shift so do prospective debris volumes and locations. This project addresses the need for integrative models that reflect the complex coupling between human-built-natural systems that underpin debris generation in storm events and the cascading impacts on coastal communities. This project examines the drivers of debris patterns and also develops models that couple those insights with infrastructure, socio-demographic, and human health impacts, among others. Resulting insights can inform policy decisions, coastal planning and risk mitigation, and debris management.  Synthesis of model outcomes and policy implications will be shared via web hosted interactive story mapping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will transform our understanding of debris generation from coastal storms and its cascading consequences on communities by deriving coupled models of the interactions between human-built-natural systems. New methods will be developed for probabilistic modeling of debris presence and volumes, harnessing and fusing empirical data from past events, storm simulations, and physics-based estimates of fragility. A significant departure from traditional debris prediction models will be afforded by introducing nested statistical surrogate models informed by multi-resolution land use/land cover characteristics, physical vulnerability of structures or vegetation, and multi-hazard storm intensities. As a result, coupled models of development and debris potential are enabled for the first time to explore current and future storm risks and policy scenarios. By integrating models of the cascading consequences of debris with socio-demographic characteristics, this project will also shed new light on relationships between regional debris effects and social vulnerability that can inform future planning, management and mitigation efforts. Knowledge co-production and the practical viability of research methods will be advanced by working with stakeholders in testbed communities, to increase the likelihood that resulting models will be useful for future plans and decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, enrollment in engineering technology at the College is not sufficient to meet the demand. To address this opportunity, the engineering technology program will partner with local industry to provide students with internship and career opportunities. Partners include Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, OG Packing, and Wong Enterprises. The project will work with these partners to expand recruitment and implement interventions designed to increase student retention. Activities will include collaborating with other departments at the College, developing a cohort model to build peer support, introducing work-based learning opportunities, hosting career and academic workshops, and offering post-graduation career services. The expected outcomes include an increase in enrollment in all engineering technology courses, in retention of the student cohort, and in the associate degree completion rate. The project will support five summer internships at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and other partners each year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will work to increase the number of students who enter the engineering technology program and complete an associate degree in engineering technology.

However, effectively delivering proteins and nucleic acids into cells could enable the treatment of a number of previously incurable diseases. Here, the PI proposes to create natural small lipid vesicles that contain pores. These will allow large molecules to be transported directly into cells. To load these small lipid vesicles with therapeutic molecules, biomaterials composed of nucleic acids will be engineered. To ensure that the lipid vesicles will only target specific cells, the vesicles will be decorated with molecules that can detect diseased cells. This research is expected to have broad impact across several scientific disciplines including biomaterials, nucleic acid and drug delivery, nanotechnology, and cell-mimicking materials. The fundamental knowledge gained from the proposal will significantly change the way that membrane-impermeable compounds are delivered to cells, especially for large molecules. This has important implications for human health because these carriers should allow diseases that are currently undruggable to be treated more safely and efficiently. The project will also enhance the nation's education infrastructure by developing a new biomaterials curriculum for graduate students and by delivering interactive teaching modules to high schools.

These poresomes will be used to deliver macromolecules to the cytoplasm while bypassing endosomes. Despite tremendous progress in nanoscience, the cytoplasmic delivery of membrane-impermeable compounds such as negatively charged RNA remains challenging. This is because a significant fraction of the RNA that is delivered remains trapped in the endosomes, where it ultimately degrades. The objective of this CAREER proposal is to overcome these challenges by engineering cell-mimicking RNA-loaded lipid vesicles that are equipped with pores composed of connexin membrane channels. It is hypothesized that microRNA(miRNA)-loaded poresomes will connect to the connexin membrane channels of recipient cells to form gap junctions. In this way, miRNAs will be directly delivered into the cytoplasm whilst bypassing the degradative endosomal and lysosomal environments (Objective 1). Further, to effectively load poresomes with therapeutic cargo, the PI proposes to synthesize EXOmers, RNA-based sequences that are capable of exploiting the cellular trafficking machinery used to actively sort macromolecules into poresomes. Structure activity analyses will be performed to develop highly efficient sequences (Objective 2). Third, multifunctional poresomes that target non-internalizing receptors will be engineered to mediate cellular anchoring and facilitate miRNA transport through gap junctions (Objective 3). The educational goals are to (i) increase participation of underrepresented students through more understandable, relatable, and accessible science and (ii) improve biomaterials and nanoscience education for graduate, undergraduate, and high school students. We will harness the learning advantages provided by visualization and animation to teach complex scientific subject matter.

2002341.xml,Doctoral Dissertation Research: The Data Economy and the Practice of Everyday Life,NSF,2020-05-01,2022-09-30,15892,"Mobile money is a fast growing global phenomenon with $1.3 billion processed daily, nearly 1 billion registered users, and explosive 20% year-on-year global growth.  In this system, credit is offered through online platforms—often unregulated— and distributed via mobile money. In economies where exchange leans heavily on close social ties, such impersonal and socially invisible sources of digital credit represent a radical break with the bases of social order. How should we understand this juncture of digital financial circuits with household economies? How do individuals come to adopt, avoid, or use digital credit amidst a dense network of socially negotiated economic relations? And, in turn, how does the introduction of technocratic relations of debt and credit reshape existing social and economic relations? This technological expansion is often framed in terms of democratized access to the global economy, and is supported by research that examines the effect of financial-technology interventions on standard economic measures such as income. While empirically valuable, such research neglects questions of how mundane technological interventions may have broader social and political consequences. This project examines how new digital infrastructures: 1) present occasions to re-arrange existing relations of exchange and negotiation in the market; and 2) enable or constrain processes of valuation, and therefore value creation, in the market. This process-oriented approach sheds light not only on current developments but also on what a technologically-mediated economic future may look like. In the way that 20th century road infrastructure still shapes collective life, how digital financial infrastructures are laid down today is likely to have far-reaching consequences. This project presents an early opportunity to examine such futures, thus providing guidance for policy-makers looking to help societies adapt to this important technological change.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project studies the case of changing relations of personal credit and debt amidst a booming digital market for household and personal finance. The project adopts a mixed methods approach using nationally representative survey data, qualitative interviews, and ethnographic observation in sequence to: 1) establish statistical findings about the current state of the digital economy, 2) examine how cultural narratives frame the deployment and adoption of digital finance, and 3) offer a processual account of how digital finance infrastructure re-orders exchange in everyday life. In partnership with local research organizations, the project first collects both self-reported data on social and economic behavior as well as digital trace data such as mobile money transaction logs from a nationally representative sample of 1,800 smartphone users. The project uses regression analysis and computational cluster analysis to identify key axes of variation along which the use of digital finance is patterned. The project then conducts up to 100 semi-structured interviews with developers and users of the new economy to examine how different cultural narratives and practices shape how digital finance is both designed and integrated into everyday life. Finally, the project conducts ethnographic observations in key urban and peri-urban sites to gather the evidence of people’s lives.  Findings from the project will contribute to sociological theories regarding the operation of financial markets and the effects of technological change on exchange relationships within the context of a changing global economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The specific aims of this project are to: develop and optimize a protocol to print customized PEEK structure with minimum artifacts; identify an economical method to develop nano-pillars on the surface of the 3D printed PEEK and then functionalize the generated nano-pillars with bone protein factor; and evaluate the bactericidal and bone osseointegration properties of the newly modified surfaces. Findings from this work will provide a better understanding of ways to modify the surface at the nanoscale and mechanisms by which bacterial cells are killed on contact while allowing the mammalian cells to grow on them simultaneously. This project will be conducted in collaboration with Virginia Commonwealth University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2003248.xml,Doctoral Dissertation Research: Assessing Factors that Influence Streamflow,NSF,2020-06-15,2021-11-30,17023,"This project will quantify how factors that influence streamflow change over space and time. Streamflow is an important source of water for industrial and domestic uses. Changes and intra-annual variations in streamflow pose management challenges and may cause devastating societal and economic consequences. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the underlying mechanisms that drive such changes. This project will significantly improve the understanding of the water cycle, support the development of more effective water balance models, and provide improved projections of future water availability. This project will identify areas that face water shortages and require greater priority in future water management efforts. Research findings will be disseminated to local and regional watershed and water resources managers. In addition, the project will promote teaching and training by involving undergraduates in modeling water availability and by supporting an undergraduate research assistant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unraveling the relative importance of different factors that influence streamflow is essential for a holistic understanding of hydrology. There is a knowledge gap regarding knowing which non-climatic factors are the most important contributors to streamflow variations at various timescales, and how the relative importance of climatic and non-climatic factors varies over time. To address the knowledge gap, this project has three research questions: (1) How does the relative role of climatic and non-climatic drivers change over space and time? (2) What non-climatic factors are the most important and how do they vary over space and time? (3) How will streamflow change in the next thirty years? These questions will be answered using a water balance model combined with statistical analyses across a large number of watersheds in the continental United States. This project will inform adaptive watershed management and will have significant implications for future interactions between water, energy, food security, and human wellbeing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, ammonia combustion suffers from two major issues which are preventing its practical application. One is that ammonia flame is very unstable and can easily get extinguished. The other issue is its high emission, which pollutes the environment. In this project, a collaborative team will investigate using plasma (electric discharge) to enhance ammonia combustion process and reduce emission at the same time. The plasma-ammonia combustion interaction has not been studied previously. This award will investigate the underlying physical and chemical processes using experimental and computational tools. The new insights gained from experimental data will be used to develop computational models that can be used in research related to renewable energy. In this project, undergraduate and graduate students will receive hands-on training in experimental and computational skills. They become new contributors to the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce of United States. Significant opportunities exist at both University of Minnesota and Georgia Institute of Technology to engage underrepresented students and researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to understand the physical and chemical processes to stabilize ammonia flames and reduce NOx emission simultaneously by non-equilibrium plasma. This project has two key hypotheses: (1) prompt ammonia oxidation/decomposition introduced by plasma enhances flame; (2) the production of NH and NH2 from plasma reduces NOx emission. Accordingly, the scope and objectives of this proposed research are: (i) investigation of fundamental ammonia plasma chemical kinetics to understand its prompt dissociation and oxidation induced by plasma at different values of reduced electric field (E/N). This will be achieved by conducting experiments in a flow reactor with speciation measurement and one-dimensional (1D) numerical simulations with detailed plasma and combustion chemical kinetics; (ii) investigation of interactions between plasma kinetics and flame dynamics (including lean blow-off and thermoacoustic combustion instability) by conducting experiments in a model gas turbine combustor using NH, NH2, NO and OH planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) and three-dimensional (3D) direct numerical simulations (DNS) with a simplified plasma model deduced from detailed 1D modeling. The experimental work will be conducted by the Georgia Institute of Technology team and the numerical work will be conducted by the University of Minnesota team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2002428.xml,Collaborative Research: A North Pacific ice core record of summer climate and wildfire history during the last 1500 years,NSF,2020-09-01,2023-08-31,85894,"This project intends to use the Mount Denali ice core archive to develop the most comprehensive suite of North Pacific fire and summer climate proxy records since about 2500 years before present. Wildfire is a key component of summer climate in the North Pacific where wildfires are projected to increase with continued summer warming. Studies that combine paleorecords of summer climate and wildfire are therefore critically needed, especially in the North Pacific region where fire recurrence rate and decadal-to-centennial scale climate fluctuations occur over longer time periods than are covered by direct observations. The goal of the proposed research is to improve our understanding of relationships between summertime climate and wildfire activity, focusing especially on the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), when regional temperatures were perhaps as warm as the 20th century. Recent advances now permit the measurement of new fire-related (pyrogenic) compounds in ice cores, enabling the development of a robust fire record capable of rigorous comparison with regional paleoclimate reconstructions. <br/><br/>The records of summer atmospheric circulation developed through this project will be regionally unique and fill a critical gap in the suite of North Pacific paleoclimate records. The ice core fire records will have synchronously dated temperature, precipitation and circulation time series. Our unique compilation of these ice core records, as well as other regional paleoproxy records will be the first effort at combining these datasets into a regional compilation of paleofire records in the North Pacific region. This compilation will facilitate the examination of fire activity during Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) conditions that are of comparable magnitude to present climate changes over socially relevant timescales (decades). We will analyze the archive Denali ice core for black carbon, which is derived from both biomass and fossil fuel combustion, and organic aromatic acids (e.g. vanillic acid) and monosaccharide anhydride (e.g. levoglucosan) which are produced solely from biomass burning. The Denali ice core chronology is already developed, and the archive ice is in hand, ensuring that our research plan can be accomplished. Fire record synthesis and calibration will incorporate instrumental fire databases, gridded burn area data, and HYSPLIT back-trajectory analyses over the instrumental era in order to test the sensitivity of fireclimate relationships over time. With this record we will address the following research questions: (1) How have North Pacific summer atmospheric circulation patterns varied over the last 1500 years? (2) How did North Pacific fire regime characteristics naturally respond to the warm summer conditions of the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA)? (3) Are there consistent relationships between North Pacific fire regime and climate?<br/><br/>A focal point of our broader impacts is support for two young investigators who have specialized expertise in North Pacific ice cores and paleofire modeling, respectively. This project will also support one PhD student and several undergraduate students. We will continue our longstanding collaboration with Denali National Park to present and permanently display our major climate- and fire-related findings at the park visitor center in Talkeetna, Alaska. We are partnering with the Natural Sciences Education and Outreach Center at Colorado State University to develop STEM kits focused on the Denali ice core record for distribution to under-served K-12 students in Alaska and Maine. Prototypes of these kits have already been developed and tested with students, and we propose to significantly expand this program and increase its impact. Other activities include the participation of first-year women researchers in this project as part of the Dartmouth Women In Science Project (WISP) initiative, and through participation in the NSF-supported School of Ice, where faculty from historically black colleges and minority-serving institutions learn about ice cores and climate change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2000610.xml,"Hodge Filtration, Singularities, and Complex Birational Geometry",NSF,2020-07-01,2020-08-31,163302,"This project addresses problems of fundamental interest in pure mathematics, and especially in the field of algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest branches of mathematics, as people have attempted for a very long time to use algebra in order to understand problems in geometry, and at the same time one that has seen some of the most outstanding modern developments and connections with areas of pure and applied science. The main aim of the project is to connect parts of algebraic and complex geometry that have previously been quite disjoint; in particular, it uses new tools (called Hodge modules), relying heavily on topology and analysis as well, in order to classify geometric shapes and singularities. This approach is generating numerous projects for Ph.D. students and the project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, the PI will continue applying the theory of mixed Hodge modules to concrete problems in complex and birational geometry. He will also continue developing the theory of Hodge ideals, in collaboration with M. Mustata. This has been completed for Q-divisors, providing an extension of the theory of multiplier ideas in this setting, but new ideas need to be brought into play in order to obtain a similar picture for ideal sheaves, or for local cohomology. One hopes that this will lead to further interesting applications. In their work the PI and Mustata have already obtained applications regarding the singularities of theta divisors, hypersurfaces in projective space, or minimal exponents. In addition to further consequences along these lines, they will use the proposed extensions in order to study, for instance, effective bounds for linear series, or roots of the Bernstein-Sato polynomial. The PI has also been involved in applying the theory of Hodge modules towards the study of the variation of families smooth projective varieties of varieties, e.g. Brody hyperbolicity or Viehweg-type questions for parameter spaces. He will extend this study to families of singular varieties, especially those that appear in the theory of moduli of higher dimensional varieties according to Kollár and others, perhaps using those Hodge modules that extend variations of mixed Hodge structure. The PI will also continue working towards the classification of subvarieties with minimal cohomology class on principally polarized abelian varieties, and its link with generic vanishing subschemes and with the singularities of theta divisors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000554.xml,CAREER:  Mechanobiology of Septins in the Cytoskeleton,NSF,2019-09-01,2023-02-28,449041,"Understanding the mechanisms of how cells manipulate their own material properties will provide new ways to treat disease and a way to develop new engineering materials. The cells and tissues that make up living organisms have material properties just like any other substance. When exposed to mechanical forces, such as pulling or pushing, they stretch and change shape. They can even generate these forces themselves.  The material properties of cells are controlled by the cytoskeleton, a collection of filamentous proteins. This network of filaments gives cells their shape, much like the skeleton defines the human shape. In cells, however, this network is dynamic and adaptive, reorganizing itself to help cells perform various functions or to resist outside mechanical stresses. The cytoskeleton thus represents a new class of material that doesn't obey the traditional models of engineering materials. It can modulate its material properties in both space and time.  This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will determine how the cell is able to spatially and temporally regulate its material properties and unearth novel design principles that can be used to develop new engineering materials and to understand how some diseases affect cell behavior. Sitting at the interface between physics, biology, and engineering, this multi-disciplinary work will inform research across a broad spectrum of fields. Most importantly, it will create opportunities for a diverse set of students and young researchers to develop innovative skills and perspectives, in particular learning to communicate novel methods and ideas across disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cytoskeleton is a model system for developing insights into non-equilibrium mechanics and network dynamics, and is known to both generate and respond to mechanical signals. Despite the fact that the principal molecular biochemical interactions have been well detailed, we still lack an understanding of how macroscopic scale behaviors emerge from the collection of many molecular interactions. Septins are the least studied filaments that make up the cytoskeleton. They bind to both actin and the plasma membrane, and have been shown to localize specifically to regions of actin curvature and mechanical stress. This research project will test the hypothesis that septins help to regulate the material properties of the cytoskeleton by altering the local architecture. This work will measure the material properties of septin-actin networks in both living cells and purified protein networks, and test the response of these networks to mechanical perturbations such as micropatterning to control cell shape, traction force microscopy, and optogenetics to induce local contractions. In addition to potentially uncovering novel mechanisms to regulate cell shape, this work will also generate insight into how molecular interactions in a network are integrated into macroscopic behaviors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001082.xml,SaTC: CORE: Small: Collaborative: Exploring the Boundaries of Large-Scale Secure Computation,NSF,2020-07-01,2024-06-30,199917,"As the capability and connectivity of communication networks scale up, existing secure distributed protocols need to resort to a frugal use of their communication resources to ensure their scalability. Secure multi-party computation (MPC), which allows a set of mutually distrustful parties to perform arbitrary computations on their joint inputs in a secure way, even in the presence of malicious participants and attackers, epitomizes such kind of secure distributed computation, and despite great improvements in all communication metrics over the last decade, existing solutions do not scale well in settings where a large number of participants are involved. One of the reasons is that in standard MPC protocols every party needs to directly communicate will all other parties, yielding protocols with high communication costs. Recently, some attempts to address this issue were made to carry out MPC with lower communication costs. The project's impacts are to put forth a systematic study of this type of MPC protocols, which we call ""Communication-Frugal MPC"" (CF-MPC), and to advance its theoretical foundations to meet the state of the art comparable to standard MPC. In an era where computation on large data has become a dominant application, such exploration is of central importance in both theory and practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's novelties include: (1) Development of a rigorous and composable cryptographic model for capturing CF-MPC; (2) feasibility study of CF-MPC with optimal resiliency (i.e., the maximal number of potentially malicious participants that can be tolerated) across all standard communication and adversary models (synchronous vs asynchronous, and static vs adaptive); and (3) improved constructions on additional communication metrics such as message, bit, and round complexity.

2001211.xml,Doctoral Dissertation Research: Judging Social Minority Job Candidates: An Intersectional Analysis of Employer Behavior towards Social Minorities in the U.S. Labor Force,NSF,2020-02-15,2021-01-31,15999,"This project examines the intersection of social identity and race on hiring outcomes for women in the United States. Specifically, the project asks: Are women who are perceived to be social minorities discriminated against when applying to jobs in the United States? Does the effect of being a social minority differ for white and black women? Does the gender composition of the job, or the personality traits employers seek, affect whether social minorities are disadvantaged? If so, do these patterns differ by race? And lastly, what are some mechanisms behind disadvantaging or favoring social minorities compared to majorities in the labor market? This research is especially pertinent because labor market inequalities between social minority and majority men have been well-documented both theoretically and empirically, but there is less consensus on whether female social minorities experience workplace penalties compared to majority women. Analyzing how workplace bias against social minorities may vary by different contextual or demographic factors can not only help shed light on long-term psychological effects and economic disadvantages that such employees face, but it can also influence public policies designed to bring about greater equality for all individuals in the U.S. labor market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project consists of two experiments. First, the project implements a large-scale résumé audit study that includes job applications to over 3,000 jobs across 6 states using 4 fictitious résumés that vary by race and social minority status. This study will obtain an estimate of whether and to what extent social minorities experience penalties compared to majority women, where the applications also vary by race, at the first point of contact with an employer. Next, the project conducts a survey experiment that recruits 1,500 hiring managers and asks them to rate the same fictitious women’s résumés on various traits, such as perceived competence, morality, professionalism, and masculinity. This experiment supplements the résumé audit study data in that it helps to illuminate the mechanisms behind disfavoring—or favoring—social minorities compared to majority women, who also vary by race, regarding labor market outcomes. These findings will inform sociological theories regarding the operation of the labor market, particularly regarding the varying experiences that women who vary by social status experience throughout the job application process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001599.xml,"Higher Structures,  Homotopy Algebras, and  Noncommutative Geometry",NSF,2020-09-01,2024-08-31,300000,"This project involves problems in noncommutative geometry. The idea of noncommutative geometry is to study noncommutative algebras using tools inspired by geometry. Noncommutative algebras are mathematical objects that have addition and multiplication; however the order in which the elements get multiplied might matter. The purpose of the project, which is centered&lt;br/&gt;around higher structures and homotopy algebras in noncommutative geometry, is to investigate mathematical problems motivated by physics in these fields. More specifically, the project is motivated by a combination of ideas from quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, string theory, and classical areas of mathematics such as Lie theory, representation theory, complex geometry, homological algebra, foliation theory, deformation quantization and index theory, and noncommutative geometry. The interdisciplinary nature of the proposed project promotes further interaction between these fields. The PI continues to disseminate his research by speaking at conferences and seminars and organizing workshops, which provide excellent opportunities for the PI to exchange, interact and collaborate with colleagues from within and outside the US and, in particular, young scientists. This award will support the training of early career researchers that work on related fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In noncommutative geometry one studies algebras as if they were algebras of functions on manifolds. However, these noncommutative spaces are virtual and not made of points. Dg manifolds are one particular type of such a noncommutative spaces. The space of functions on a dg manifold is a differential graded algebra. Another important class of noncommutative spaces is obtained as deformations of commutative algebras. Deformation quantization aims at throwing a bridge between classical and quantum mechanics. The mathematical structures of the two theories are very different, making it a challenging problem to understand how the transition from classical to quantum works. Quantization, roughly speaking, is the study and prediction of quantum phenomena, which are normally described by noncommutative algebras, from the geometry of their underlying classical counterparts. The PI proposes to continue the study of higher structures and homotopy algebras arising naturally in noncommutative geometry and their relation to representation theory using tools from deformation quantization and Lie algebroid theory. The problems include investigating the role of the Todd class in Tamarkin-Tsygan calculi associated with a  dg manifold, studying the formal geometry of dg manifolds and the concept of homotopy equivalence of dg Lie algebroids, establishing a Kontsevich-Duflo type theorem in a wide context, and exploring negatively graded dg manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000607.xml,Collaborative Research: Should I Stay or Should I Go? Understanding the Retention of Latinx in Engineering Jobs,NSF,2020-08-15,2025-07-31,738011,"Slow progress has been made over the past several years to broaden the involvement of groups who are underrepresented in engineering disciplines. The number of Latinxs in particular continues to decrease at each transition point along the pathway to becoming a practicing engineer (i.e., declaring a engineering major, graduating with an engineering degree, working in the engineering field). Increased efforts across the engineering ecosystem, but specifically during the college-to-work transition, are needed to broaden the participation of Latinxs (one of the fastest growing ethnic groups in the U.S.) and to meet the industry demands to fill engineering jobs, which are projected to increase in the next decade. This project aims to understand environmental, personal, and psychological factors that influence work engagement, satisfaction, and persistence decisions during the college-to-work transition among Latinx in engineering, as well as during the early years of their career. The investigators will conduct annual surveys, experiential surveys, and individual interviews about workplace experiences with Latinx in the engineering workforce across a 5-year period to track factors related to Latinx engineers’ work engagement, job satisfaction, and persistence in the field. This project is a joint effort between the University of Missouri and the University of North Dakota and is supported by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development. Additional support has been provided by the Directorate for Engineering's Broadening Participation in Engineering (BPE) program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As posited by the integrative social cognitive career theory lens, the investigators hypothesize that the relations among social cognitive, contextual and cultural factors will explain a significant amount of variance in Latinx engineers’ work engagement, satisfaction, and persistence. Structural equation modeling (SEM) will be used to examine this hypothesis longitudinally. The investigators will assess the integrative SCCT model’s generalizability based on gender, race, and the interaction of gender and race via SEM multigroup analyses.  The investigators also will use experience sampling methodology to gather fine-grained snapshots of perceived workplace climate to examine the effects of momentary and longitudinal changes in such perceptions on Latinx engineers’ work engagement, satisfaction, and persistence via multilevel modeling and growth modeling. Finally, they will generate a reliable and valid measure of engineering interests for employed engineers using factor analytical and Item Response Theory techniques. Potential outcomes of the project include: 1) examining the utility of the integrative SCCT model in predicting engagement, satisfaction, and persistence in engineering for Latinxs in engineering during the college-to-work transition and early career stages; 2) a new measure of engineering interests for use in future research; and 3) the development of custom interventions to augment relevant systemic supports, minimize systemic barriers, and bolster social cognitions that are strong predictors of work engagement, satisfaction, and persistence for Latina women and Latino men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002169.xml,I-Corps: Plant sterols as potential pre-emergent herbicides,NSF,2020-02-01,2022-07-31,50000,"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide low-cost weed control while improving the environment and human health. Weeds can reduce farming yields by 60-75%, even when using best practices. The proposed herbicide is a combination of abundant natural chemicals operating with a different chemical mode of action, and thus it does not generate resistance, and may even help support stronger plants.  This technology will help support farm production and profitability, and its use may diversify the food supply.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the discovery of a herbicide that has new mode of action:  when genes for sterol biosynthesis change and become inactive through mutation or genetic engineering, plant seeds do not complete germination; and if they do germinate, they have severely stunted growth. By applying plant (or animal) sterols that are final products of sterol biosynthesis in an appropriate encapsulation agent to germinating seeds, the exogenous sterols inhibit seed sterol production, thus causing a decrease in total sterols similar to the effects of gene inactivation.  Application of exogenous sterols phenocopies or mimics the effects of mutation of several different sterol biosynthetic genes, reducing complete germination, causing changes in plant vasculature, and producing severe dwarfing when given during seed germination. This effect is broad spectrum, affecting both monocots and dicots. Furthermore, herbicide application to plants that have already germinated and are actively growing experience minimal or beneficial effects on growth. The beneficial effects include slight stunting of stems, which may make crops more resistant to wind and hail damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2003354.xml,Measurements of Electron Weibel Instability in a Laboratory Plasma Using Relativistic Electron Beams,NSF,2020-08-01,2024-07-31,760682,"Most of the matter that one can observe in the universe is in a plasma state comprised of electrically charged particles, electrons and ions. It is therefore imperative to understand the behavior of plasmas in order to explain galactic formation, gamma-ray bursts, and  our own Sun. Often, the temperature of electrons in a plasma is hotter in one direction than in the other. Such plasmas are said to be anisotropic. An anisotropic plasma eventually becomes isotropic -- reaching the same temperature in all three dimensions of space -- by a process known as the Weibel instability.  The Weibel instability was predicted by Weibel almost 50 years ago, but it has been impossible to check the theory of how rapidly this instability grows and why it eventually stops growing (saturates) because it has not been possible to generate a plasma with known temperature anisotropy in the laboratory.  This project aims to measure the generation and saturation of the Weibel instability for the first time.  This experimental work will be performed by the University of California - Los Angeles team  at the Accelerator Test Facility at Brookhaven National Laboratory, and will involve training of a graduate student and a postdoctoral associate in plasma and accelerator science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highly anisotropic plasmas can be produced by optical field ionization of He gas using a circularly polarized laser pulse, resulting in a plasma that is very hot in the transverse direction but rather cold in the direction of propagation of the laser. Such a plasma undergoes a hierarchy of plasma kinetic instabilities, starting with the two stream instability and current filamentation instability that reduce the plasma anisotropy from ~100 to less than 10 in a pico-second. Thereafter, the electron Weibel instability begins to grow, seeded by coalescence of currents associated with the filamentation instability.  The pure Weibel instability is characterized by rapid growth of a static magnetic field with a broad wavenumber spectrum. This wavenumber spectrum quickly narrows to a fairly well defined, most unstable mode that has helicoid topology.  This work will measure the exponential growth and saturation of this magnetic field and its topology for the first time.  To measure the dynamics of the Weibel B-field, a relativistic electron beam will be used as a probe. During its passage through the plasma, the probe electrons will be deflected by the transverse component of the helicoid magnetic field.  These deflections can be visualized as probe electron density structures on a screen placed some distance away from the plasma. From images taken at different times, the evolution of the k spectrum, its spectral amplitude and 2D spatial profile of the B-field can be obtained, thereby allowing a quantitative comparison of experiment with kinetic theory of the Weibel instability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This work focuses on large-area manufacturing of ultra-thin transition metal dichalcogenide membranes to improve the precision of water filtration and treatment. This project creates new fundamental knowledge through the understanding of the mechanisms of water molecule and ion motion at atomic scales in these improved membranes. An important motivation for decreasing the membrane thickness is that it leads to increased water fluxes.

Current fabrication of 2D nanoporous membranes is often limited in terms of control or rely on the use of ion and electron beam irradiation, which is slow and costly. This work uses simple chemical etching to make holes in membranes using an industrial wet etchant, leading to controllable membrane porosity and economic manufacturing. This research answers key scientific questions about fundamental properties of ion flow as a function of membrane properties, thickness, pore size and density towards efficient water desalination in comparison with state-of-the-art polymer membranes. The research approach encompasses chemical vapor deposition growth of single- and few-atom thick 2D nanomaterials up to 4-inch wafer-scales, the optimization of 2D nanomaterials transfer on to apertures to make 2D nanomaterial membranes, followed by wet etching and transport studies to understand fundamental pore-forming and ion transport mechanisms.  The research involves optimizing the manufacture of ultrathin membranes and maximizing water flow while retaining membrane integrity. This work further develops the instrumentation towards scale-up via roll-to-roll nanomanufacturing of the nanoporous membranes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001593.xml,Collaborative Research: A Novel Biological Valorization of Hydrothermal Liquefaction Wastewater with Marine Protist and its Granulated Phenotype,NSF,2020-07-01,2025-06-30,225022,"Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) has been considered as a promising thermal processing approach to biofuel production from a broad range of organic matter, including agricultural waste biomass, municipal solid waste, and algae.  A recent U.S. Department of Energy report stated that as much as 5.9 billion gallons of biocrude could be produced each year in the U.S. from the available waste organic matter using HTL technology; this biocrude can be further refined to liquid transportation fuels using processes similar to conventional petroleum refining, replacing those fuels currently produced from non-renewable feedstocks. However, current HTL processes produce a large amount of wastewater containing high concentrations of organic compounds and nutrients; the sustainable disposal of this wastewater is one of the most significant bottlenecks to the scale-up and commercialization of HTL. This research will address concerns from both environmental and energy conversion efficiency perspectives of HTL by recovering organic carbon and nutrients from HTL wastewater. This is a critical step to increasing the net energy yield and enhancing the economic viability and environmental sustainability of HTL processes. In the course of carrying out this project, the researchers will train the next generation of scientists and engineers in biofuel production, biotechnology/bioprocessing, and environmental stewardship, all while educating the public about sustainable biofuel production and the impact of energy consumption on economic, environmental and societal sustainability.<br/><br/>The research team of this proposal has recently found that a marine protist Thraustochytrium striatum HB can survive and grow in wastewater produced from HTL processing of municipal solid waste without supplemental nutrients while removing approximately 80% total organic carbon, 100% total nitrogen, and 80% phosphorus. Additionally, the microbes were found to be tolerant of wide pH and salinity ranges (comparable to sea water) in metabolizing organic compounds in HTL wastewater while being able to form cell aggregates under harsh conditions. Therefore, marine protists hold promise to be a new class of superior microorganisms for HTL wastewater treatment and valorization. The overarching goal of this project is to establish a T. striatum HB-facilitated platform for HTL wastewater valorization to enable sustainable HTL for biofuel production. The specific objectives of this research are to: (1) elucidate the correlation between biocrude yield and the HTL wastewater composition; (2) reveal the metabolic adaptation of T. striatum HB to the new wastewater environments to enhance overall energy return and biocrude yield; and (3) explore the formation mechanisms of T. striatum HB biogranules and the resulting performance impact on HTL wastewater valorization since biogranules are more efficient in wastewater valorization compared to dispersed cells. The marine protists could be a new class of promising microorganisms for valorization of other types of high-strength wastewater. The interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research will facilitate the integration of research and educational plans to enhance the education programs of three institutes involved in this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This workshop will be devoted to presenting the latest research progress on the first-passage percolation (FPP), a probabilistic model of random growth, and closely related models.  This is currently an active research area in contemporary probability theory and has important connections to statistical physics. Part of the workshop will be devoted to training graduate students and early career researchers in those topics. This award will provide travel support for the US based participants in the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In two dimensions, FPP is a model that is conjecturally in the KPZ universality class, which consists of several models describing surface growth processes. Models in the KPZ class are intimately related with random matrix theory, asymptotic representation theory and number theory. FPP and related models have also been studied by physicists as a model for polymers in a random medium or as model of magnetic interfaces, and by biologists as the Eden model of bacterial growth. Much progress has been made on a class of these relatives which are in some senses ""exactly solvable"" by the methods of integrable probability. However, even at the physics level of heuristic, these models are poorly understood outside of solvable special cases; for instance, there are hardly any results for dimensions larger than 2. Unlike other conferences on FPP-type models, the ICTS workshop will emphasize methods outside of the integrable or exactly solvable framework. By focusing on techniques beyond exact solvability, the workshop will unify participants around solving fundamental problems of interest to the broader scientific community.

This research project will investigate the formation of the molecular ions N2H+ and N2D+, which are commonly used to trace properties of prestellar molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks. By means of a sophisticated laboratory experiment, the investigators will accurately determine the production rates of the ions at the very low temperatures relevant to interstellar clouds. Results from the study will allow astronomers to accurately determine the abundance of these ions in space and interpret observations of the earliest stages of star and planet formation.  This project will contribute to the training and professional development of a postdoctoral scholar, provide research opportunities for undergraduates, and engage the public through lectures on astrochemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a dual-source, merged fast-beams apparatus, Savin and collaborators will measure accurate integral cross sections (ICS) for six reactions of N2 with H3+ and its deuterated forms as a function of the internal temperature of the reactants.  The ICSs will allow the team to generate reliable thermal rate coefficients for N2H+ and N2D+ formation for use in astrochemical models.  The measurements will also guide astrochemical models of deuterated molecules for which laboratory data are unavailable, and they will test the validity of approximations used to interpret branching fractions of partially deuterated molecules in space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001910.xml,Doctoral Dissertation Research:  Cooperation in Uncertainty during Migration,NSF,2020-06-15,2023-01-31,16000,"Doctoral Dissertation Research:  Cooperation in Uncertainty during Migration&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates the experiences of migrants as they journey from one country to another.  Prior research indicates that the experience of migrants varies: some migrants describe experiences of harshness and neglect, while others perceive protection and support. But what account for these differences?   This project will examine how migrants negotiate the relationships with those who assist in the journeys. How do they work to safeguard themselves, and what conditions do they observe when these safeguards fail?  How do these process self-organize when laws are unenforced? And how do social networks facilitate migration?  Governments frequently ponder how to lower the risks for migrants.  Underlying some governmental policies may also be the assumption that if risks are high, migration will decrease, but current research indicates that many migrants persist in their attempts despite the risks. Identifying what conditions increase the risk of victimization for migrants will inform governmental policies to assist in safe passage for those who choose to migrate.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to understand what explains differential experiences of migrants, this project will analyze what conditions the migrants experience and when safety is supported or violated.  The project will conduct fieldwork in locales where many migration journeys begin and will rely on semi-structured, qualitative interviews of prospective migrants and returnees, i.e., those migrants who return to countries of origin. The project will stay in contact with prospective migrants through social media apps and re-interview them within a month of their migration attempt. Interview topics include the route migrants chose, who assisted them, the extent to which they relied on their social networks in these decisions, and, finally, whether they experienced support versus harshness or neglect. Returnees will provide data on the various risks they encountered. The project will interview 50 potential migrants and 50 returnees in each of several different locales. Within this group, the interviews will sample for diversity, especially rural versus urban origins, but also socioeconomic, gender and ethnic diversity in order to ensure capture a diverse range of perspectives. The project will use a snowball sampling strategy and gain access to migration-affected communities through partnerships with local service NGOs. The analysis of migrant journeys not only speaks to how humans create institutions to facilitate cooperation, but also how culture, social cleavages, and local context influence these institutional choices.  Findings from the project will contribute to sociological theories regarding migration, the law, social networks and global inequality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One consequence of Industry 4.0 is the integration of new technologies into manufacturing processes. Examples of these technologies include the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), autonomous robots, and cyber-physical systems.  Given the rapidly changing tools and processes, manufacturers nationwide often struggle to find technicians with the skills needed in these new work environments. An especially critical need exists for qualified automation/robotics technicians.  This project aims to address this urgent need in advanced manufacturing by educating technicians who have mechanical skills, together with knowledge of and skills in emerging robotic technologies. Working with industry and educational partners, Stark State College plans to improve training of automation and robotics technicians who will meet current and future industry demands. Potential societal benefits of this project include an updated, industry-aligned automation/robotics curriculum; a stackable technician educational pathway with lower time to degree; development of low-cost training units that simulate advanced manufacturing environments; and a professional development model to better prepare instructors to train tomorrow's automation/robotics technicians. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the project include increasing capacity to effectively train automation/robotics technicians, improving the quality of technician education by better aligning it to workforce needs, and expanding awareness of advanced manufacturing careers among high school students and thus increase participation in automation/robotics programs at both secondary and postsecondary levels. The project aims to achieve these goals by: 1) updating the automation/robotics program curriculum to include training on Industry 4.0 technologies, such as IIoT; 2) creating a new IIoT-focused educational pathway to support student recruitment and retention from high school through associate degree completion; 3) developing low-cost training units to complement the new pathway and curriculum; 4) conducting IIoT boot camps and workshops to engage high school students; and 5) providing professional development to high school and college faculty to grow teaching proficiency and encourage curriculum adoption. Project deliverables and outcomes will be disseminated through regional and national meetings, publications, and webinars or other online mechanisms.

Virginia Union University is a Historically Black College with several oustanding assets.  They have a diverse student body and so are able to recruit from an undergraduate population of traditionally under-represented groups.  In addition, the University is only about an hour's drive from the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLAB) and so it is neither difficult, nor expensive, for the faculty and students to travel to JLAB to do their experimental work. Through this research, graduates of the VUU program will receive hands-on experience and emerge as well-trained nuclear scientists who are capable of important contributions to national energy, medical, and security needs.<br/><br/>The proposal describes contributions to the BONuS12 experiment at JLAB. The BONuS12 experiment is designed to measure the structure function of the neutron. In general, there is a lack of neutron structure function data in the literature because a pure neutron target does not exist and thus the data must be inferred from neutron rich targets (such as deuterium).  This project will contribute to the BONuS12 experiment by significantly improving the systematic errors associated with knowing the density of the target by building a slow controls system to monitor the flow of gas into the target region.  This is an ideal undergraduate project when mentored by an experienced faculty member.  The PI will also participate in the analysis of the F2 structure function data.  The structure function analysis project is not a task that undergraduates can complete, alone, but elements of the analysis are approachable by undergraduates and the analyses will serve as a excellent tutorial for the students in modern data handling and analysis techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Graphene (sheets of carbon atoms arranged in a rigid structure that resembles chicken wire) is perforated to form an ordered array of holes.  These holes then act as handles to accommodate nanoparticles.  The goal behind the synthesis of this nanoparticle construction is that the decoration of holey graphene with select metallic nanoparticle dopants may act to tune the graphene electronic properties to enhance their sensing and catalytic properties.  Success in achieving this objective may impact the fields of energy and environmental remediation as the research may open the way for practical applications, such as in water splitting to form hydrogen fuel and carbon dioxide use in useful chemical products.  A diverse group of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students are trained as they conduct this research.  The concepts of sensors and energy are incorporated in instructional videos and practical demonstrations communicated to the general public. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Professor Star and his research team are working on the synthesis of holey graphene metal nanoparticle composites (GNCs) and the evaluation of their properties and potential applications in sensing and catalysis.  The formation of holey graphene is accomplished with oriented covalent organic framework growth as a template followed by reactive ion etching.  It is hypothesized that graphene’s band potential can be doped with a versatile range of nanoparticles to match the redox potential of specific analytes.  This precise matching may enhance sensing and catalytic behavior.  The holey graphene edges-nanoparticles interfaces are manipulated by varying the size and the activity of the holes and the chemical nature of the nanoparticles to tune the graphene work function.  The idea is to match the work function to the redox potential of the molecular probes in both gas and aqueous environments to enhance the sensing of these probes and establish a link between sensing and catalytic behavior.  Different GNCs are being synthesized and evaluated to facilitate the electrocatalytic splitting of water and to control the electrocatalytic product formation resulting from carbon dioxide reduction. Structural characterization of the composite materials is accomplished using a suite of analytical tools and electrochemical methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In practice, the difficulty in applying learning algorithms in communication systems comes from a paradigm shift in the methodology: From conventional model-based analytical solutions to data-driven empirical-result-based approaches. While learning algorithms offer better flexibility and efficiency in using computational resources, the lack of guarantees in the performance, robustness and security raise issues when adopting into engineering designs. The goal of this project is to combine learning-based data-driven approaches with conventional model-based analysis, to design novel learning algorithms that can utilize the structural knowledge of engineering systems, thus reaping the advantages of both methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the physical layer of wireless networks, where analytical solutions, clearly defined performance benchmarks, as well as clearly isolated modeling deficiencies are usually present.

Focus will be on trace metals and organic peroxides, latter of which represent a new class of molecules to be studied in this context. Results from ambient aerosol analyses, laboratory simulations and chamber experiments will inform parametrization of OH production for incorporation into larger scale climate models.<br/> <br/>The project aims at increasing understanding of mechanisms of atmospheric production of OH in cloud droplets. The work is motivated by the PI’s observation of an initial and substantial burst in OH production when exposing aerosols to near-UV radiation. Identifying new OH sources in cloud droplets has important and potentially transformative implications on many chemical and physical atmospheric processes that affect global climate and human health. The three-pronged experimental approach consists of measuring OH production in (i) collected and chemically analyzed ambient aerosols of various types; (ii) controlled laboratory experiments using a series of synthesized (hydro)peroxides, trace metals, and varying pH, conductivity, and wavelength; and (iii) chamber generated aerosol particles. A new semi-portable instrument (direct-to liquid OH analyzer) is sought to be developed that allows aerosols to grow to droplets that are collected and analyzed for OH formation on the time scale of tens of minutes to hours. Chemical kinetic modeling of results from all components of the experimental approach will be used to derive rate constants and parametrization for implementation in larger scale models.

The major goal is to identify instructional strategies that better prepare undergraduate students for doing authentic scientific experimentation in physics labs. Traditional laboratory exercises have trained students to view instructional laboratories as places to do rote procedures that lead to known results. This project will probe how to help students reframe their expectations so that they consider physics labs as places to engage in scientific experiementation.  Specifically, this project intends to identify strategies that help students think of physics labs as places where they will design their own experiments and draw their own conclusions from the data they collect.

Such motion is called electrophoresis and is important in lab-on-a-chip devices, e-ink displays, pigments, coatings, and the petroleum industry. A central objective is to quantify the ratio of the speed of the particle to the voltage strength, which is known as the electrophoretic mobility. Such measurements are conducted to infer the electrical charge of a particle, a key quantity in predicting the behavior of suspensions of particles. One complication is that electrophoretic mobility may depend on the voltage in non-linear way, particularly with large voltages in organic electrolytes (e.g. oils doped with surfactant molecules).   However, predictive models for this nonlinear, voltage-dependent mobility are lacking. Thus, the intellectual merit of this project is to develop theory and numerical computations to predict the nonlinear mobility, which will be compared to experimental measurements. A broader technological impact is the development of new methods to determine particle charge to aid in designing dispersions with enhanced stability, which will benefit the formulation of household and personal-care products that use organic solvents. The educational broader impact of this project includes course development, undergraduate research, and outreach activities. For the latter, educational modules for K-12 students will be developed and integrated into existing outreach programs at Carnegie Mellon University.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project is to predict the electric field-dependent mobility of a charged colloidal particle via numerical solution of the electrokinetic equations governing fluid flow, ion transport and reaction kinetics, and electrostatic fields in electrophoresis. These predictions will be compared against experimental measurements, which will enable feedback to refine modeling assumptions. The numerical scheme will employ a custom spectral element code that is ideally suited to the task. The project is split into two technical objectives. Objective 1 is focused on steady electrophoresis under a uniform, steady (dc) field, for which the mobility is time independent. The goal is to compute the field-dependent mobility over the entire range of experimentally relevant field strength. In objective 2, particle motion under a single frequency ac field will be examined, for which the mobility is time dependent. Here, the hypothesis is that the nonlinear distortion of the Debye cloud, beyond the weak-field limit, leads to rectified migration under an ac field, due to a mismatch in the diffusion coefficients of the cations and anions in an electrolyte. The project is novel since previous efforts have predominantly focused on weak applied fields, where the mobility is field-independent. The project will generate new computational tools to analyze experiments on nonlinear electrophoresis. This will have a broader impact to the colloid science and soft matter communities, who will be able to use the results to infer surface charge from field-dependent mobility measurements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, engineering laboratory equipment is not usually portable for use outside of the lab and can be expensive.  This project will develop 3D printed laboratory devices that support student learning of mechanical engineering concepts and that are also inexpensive, compact, modular, and portable.  The devices can be used in the laboratory, but also in classroom demonstrations and at home.  Analogous to engaging in undergraduate research experiences, an undergraduate Research Design Group will plan, print, and evaluate the new devices.  Thus, undergraduates will be involved in design and production of laboratory devices that are intended to support the learning of other students.  The devices will be bundled with ready-to-use learning activities designed using a learning sciences approach.  An online repository containing device plans and associated learning activities will enable other engineering programs to adopt this approach.

The project will address two research questions: (1) What types of devices will enhance student learning by measuring key physical behaviors of mechanical, electrical, and electromechanical systems? (2) What is the impact on learning for students using these devices in classroom learning activities and for the students who design these devices? Student learning and professional outcomes will be assessed in lecture and laboratory courses, comparing the results of students who used the devices in the learning activities to a control group that did not have the learning activities.  Student learning will be assessed using exam questions, homework, and reflective writing. Students’ professional development will be assessed using established instruments for growth mindset, motivation, and engineering identity. Given the low cost of producing these devices, this approach could be widely adopted in the mechanical engineering education community to improve student learning. This project is supported by the NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education Program: Education and Human Resources Program, which supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000560.xml,RAPID/Collaborative Research: Japan-U.S. Collaboration on the Seismic Performance of Reinforced Concrete Structures,NSF,2019-11-01,2020-10-31,54617,"Reinforced concrete (RC) structures comprise most of the multi-family residential buildings in the U.S. and many other countries. When buildings are subjected to catastrophic events such as earthquakes, there is the need to assess their level of structural safety after the event. Structural assessment activities present two challenges - collecting high quality damage data and interpreting the acquired data in a meaningful and rational way - to produce estimates of the level of safety and residual strength of the inspected building. While advanced data acquisition systems are available to collect structural damage data, new methods are needed to analyze the collected data to assess structural performance.  This Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) will support a team of researchers from the University of Washington and the University of Nevada, Reno, to collaborate with researchers from Japanese universities on experimental research investigating the seismic performance of RC building systems.  The experimental research will involve the dynamic testing of a full-scale, three-story RC building as part of the ongoing Tokyo Metropolitan Resilience Project (TMRP) supported in Japan by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology and the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience. The experiments will be conducted at the world's largest shake table, E-Defense in Miki, Japan, in December 2019. The main goal of this RAPID project is to acquire, process, and analyze dynamic response and damage data pertaining to both structural and non-structural elements of the building. The data will be collected using equipment recently acquired by the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) RAPID Facility (https://rapid.designsafe-ci.org/) and the high-speed, high-resolution digital image correlation (DIC) integrated monitoring system recently developed at the University of Nevada, Reno. The processing and interpretation of this data will advance the state of knowledge and practice in post-earthquake structural assessments of buildings. The project will train two graduate students and several undergraduate students in structural integrity research and promote collaboration between Japanese and U.S. researchers. All collected data will be archived and made publicly available in the NSF-supported NHERI Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org/). Additionally, the results of this project will be disseminated via journal publications, conference presentations, a public webinar, and live broadcasts. This project contributes to NSF's role in the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this RAPID project, the Japanese and U.S. research team will investigate the seismic performance of a full-scale, three-story RC building system tested at the E-Defense shake table as part of the Japanese TMRP project.  The key objectives of this collaborative project are to: (1) provide better understanding of dynamic response of RC buildings, (2) investigate the capabilities of new instrumentation to capture structural performance and damage data, and (3) evaluate current post-earthquake structural assessment procedures and use the acquired data to provide information for refinements.   The collected data and structural assessment procedures will also help policymakers in the U.S., Japan, and other countries to plan retrofit efforts strategically and effectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Developing NHPI trust in the scientific enterprise requires building connections that bridge the values and concepts of ‘ike kupuna (traditional knowledge) with scientific knowledge systems and contemporary technology. This project will develop and research a pop-up science exhibit that connects indigenous Hawaiian knowledge with contemporary Western science concepts. The exhibit will show how community knowledge (that is consistent with underlying scientific principles and natural laws) has informed innovation by indigenous peoples. This community-initiated and developed project will begin with a single pop-up exhibit designed to incorporate several hands-on culture-based STEM activities that integrate traditional and modern technologies. For example, the exhibit may cover indigenous systems of star navigation for ocean voyaging, systems of netting for food and water containers, or systems of home design with local and natural materials. This project seeks to develop preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of such an approach for supporting rural Hawaiian youths’ STEM engagement, understanding, and personal connections to Native Hawaiian STEM knowledge. Findings from this pilot and feasibility study will inform the development of a larger pop-up science center grounded in indigenous Hawaiian STEM knowledge, and advance intellectual knowledge around culturally sustaining pedagogy by helping informal STEM education practitioners understand community initiated and developed STEM exhibits. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pop-up science center pilot will be led by a local Hawaiian community organization, INPEACE, in collaboration with several local community members and other community-based organizations. The preliminary research will iteratively explore whether and how an existing Hawaiian culture-based framework can be used to design hands-on STEM exhibits to enhance rural learner engagement, depth of STEM knowledge, and connection to Native Hawaiian STEM knowledge. Research efforts led by Kamehameha Schools, which has a long history of conducting research from an indigenous worldview, will engage 120 learners from various rural communities across Hawaii, from which 40 will be pre-selected middle-school youth, and 80 individuals will be from public audiences of learners ages 12 and up. Through a series of observations, interviews, pre and post surveys with validated instruments, and focus groups, the research will probe: (1) The learners’ thoughts on the science practice and its relevance to old and new Hawaii and modern society. (2) The level at which related STEM topics have been understood, and (3) The learners’ perceptions about their connection to Native Hawaiian STEM knowledge. Results from this pilot study will inform a future pop-up science center development project, and add to the scarce literature on community-driven, culturally sustaining exhibition development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is funded by the NSF Advancing Informal STEM Learning program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.

The project seeks to fill this knowledge gap by chemically and isotopically analyzing stored filter samples collected between 2005 and 2018 at various locations in southern New England. The 13-year record obtained through this study will help inform diverse fields including atmospheric chemistry, ecology, health, climate and policy.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project aims at using a unique combination of concentration and isotopic compositions to help constrain atmospheric mechanisms of nitrate and sulfate formation. Archived filters will provide a seasonal record that spans a period during which significant declines in emission of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide gases have led to associated, albeit non-linear decreases in particulate nitrate and sulfate. The cause for non-linearity is investigated by using fractionation of stable isotopes of (i) nitrogen and sulfur for fingerprinting and source apportionment of emission sources, and (ii) oxygen to inform production pathways for nitrate and sulfate. Novel data generated from this work will impact fields beyond atmospheric chemistry by inferring trends in ecological systems and global climate. The PI team will work with staff at various facilities and supervise one graduate and several undergraduate students to complete this labor-intensive analytical study. Results will also be incorporated into the atmospheric chemistry curriculum and shared in an annual outreach event for local elementary schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, shuffling a deck of cards or rotating an atom around its nucleus.  Over the last 200 years, Group Theory has been spectacularly successful in using symmetry to study a wide variety of problems in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and engineering.  More recently, starting in the 1980s, mathematicians and mathematical physicists have developed a theory of Quantum Groups and Quantum Symmetry which adapt ideas from Group Theory to more general settings appearing in quantum physics and related mathematics.  The first spectacular application of what we now call Group Theory was Galois' use of symmetries of number systems to explain why there's a generalization of the familiar quadratic formula to solve equations using third or fourth powers, but no such formula for solving equations with fifth powers.  Galois's number systems are parallel to von Neumann factors developed to study quantum mechanics, and several of the first spectacular applications of what we would know call Quantum Groups or Quantum Symmetries appeared in Jones's study of subfactors.  More recently Quantum Symmetry has become central to certain approaches to constructing quantum computers using so-called topological phases of matter.  The main techniques used in this project involve higher dimensional algebra.  Here the idea is that we typically write mathematical symbols on a line when doing calculations, but in many settings it is better to use the whole plane to draw pictures, or to do the calculation on ""paper"" in more interesting shapes like circles or spheres.  Sometimes the geometry allows for insight into the mathematics, for example you can ""rotate"" a calculation taking place in the plane.  The goal of this project is to use higher dimensional algebra to study questions in quantum symmetry. The project will also contribute to the development of the US workforce through the training of Ph.D. and high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more technical language, we use planar algebras, topological quantum field theory, and higher categories to study questions coming from von Neumann subfactors and tensor categories.  These include very example-driven questions like constructing and studying exceptional small index subfactors, as well as more theoretical questions like understanding the structure of the 3-category of fusion categories (where subfactors appear as 1-morphisms).  More specifically, this project focuses on four closely related research programs.  First, we will develop a purely algebraic analogue of the author's previous work on the classification of small index subfactors. Second we will use module categories more systematically to approach analytic questions about reconstructing subfactors from their standard invariants.  Third, we will use skein theoretic approaches and Jones's planar algebras to study tensor categories, including non-semisimple tensor categories.  Finally, we study tensor categories and braided tensor categories using higher-categories and local topological quantum field theories building on the Lurie-Baez-Dolan cobordism hypothesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These spaces are algebraic varieties, and they are studied both by examining the algebraic properties of the equations and the geometry of the solution sets.  An important feature of algebraic geometry is that a collection of algebraic varieties (e.g. the collection of all plane conic curves) often itself is an algebraic variety, and algebraic varieties appearing in this way are called moduli spaces.  The PI will study some specific moduli spaces, such as the compactified universal Jacobian and the Kontsevich moduli space of stable maps, with the goal of both better understanding them and applying their study to problems like curve counting. The grant will also support research students and the PI's outreach activities including the South Carolina Math Circle.

The PI will study the arithmetic, geometry, and topology of moduli spaces of sheaves and then to apply those results to solve counting problems (i.e. to advance enumerative geometry). The moduli spaces the PI will focus on are moduli spaces of sheaves on singular curves or compactified Jacobians, and the project consists of two broad parts. For the first part, the PI will develop the enumerative geometry of the universal compactified Jacobian, a moduli space of sheaves on stable curves, in a manner analogous to the development of the Schubert calculus of the Grassmannian variety. For the second part, the PI will count curves arithmetically using A1-homotopy theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Forthcoming transient surveys will also provide new constraints on the formation and populations of compact remnants.  One important channel, and the focus of this research, is dynamical formation in dense stellar environments like globular clusters (GCs).

This glacial cycling produces fine-grained sediments that are easily altered by chemical reactions. As glacial retreat exposes landscapes, ecosystems develop, sediments react, and stream water compositions change. In southwestern Greenland, streams draining glacial meltwater and non-glacial streams separated from glacial meltwater discharge similar amounts of water relative to their drainage areas, but because of distinct chemical compositions, they deliver differing amounts of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere and nutrients to coastal ecosystems.  These differences may affect climate, ecosystems, and people, highlighting the need for effective communication of glacial environmental changes to the public. Developing effective communication skills is an integral part of this interdisciplinary study to evaluate how biological, geochemical, and hydrologic processes control stream water composition as glaciers retreat.  This insight will enhance evaluations of the effects from past glacial retreat and responses to future Arctic warming.  Project results will be shared through environmental civics, a component that will improve researchers’ science communication and leadership skills.  <br/><br/>Sediment compositions, exposure age, plant and microbe colonization, water availability, and stream-landscape connections are hypothesized to vary systematically across periglacial watersheds and thus control weathering extent, stream geochemistry, and solute and gas fluxes.  This hypothesis will be tested in watersheds stretching from the Greenland Ice Sheet to the coast over two melt seasons by an interdisciplinary group of U.S. and Greenlandic researchers who will a) measure non-glacial stream discharge, solute and gas concentrations and fluxes, microbial community structures, plant community distributions, carbon and nutrient cycling, and radiogenic isotopes in stream and bedload sediment; b) maintain automated weather observations, dust collection, and stream chemistry loggers; and c) perform stream dosing experiments. These data will reveal feedbacks between weathering extent, ecosystem characteristics, biogeochemical processes, and stream chemistry and their controls on solute and gas fluxes from periglacial watersheds.

The beauty of the problems is that the formulations of many of them are ""intuitively clear"" not only to graduate students, but also to undergraduates, and in some cases, even to high-school pupils. On the other hand, the answers are very often counter-intuitive, requiring the use of the most advanced and sophisticated tools belonging to the different branches of modern mathematics.

2001557.xml,Doctoral Dissertation Research: Suicide Survival Narratives: How Social Statuses Affect Survivors' Cultural Narratives about Suicide Experiences,NSF,2020-04-15,2024-03-31,15986,"While a great deal of research has documented sociodemographic trends in suicide risk, a more fundamental question about how people experience suicide and how they frame those experiences across their identities remains unanswered. This project will examine how suicide survivors construct cultural narratives to make meaning of their suicide experiences in order to inform suicide prevention strategies, clinical approaches to working with suicidal populations, and post-suicide social supports. We know that variation in social statuses, such as social class, gender and race, are related to increases in suicide risk. This project will analyze such variations in survivors’ cultural narratives. The identification of social mechanisms underlying suicidality will help policy makers: 1) create and refine suicide prevention by understanding the unique circumstances that precede survivors’ suicide experiences; 2) design policy to help those who have suicidal experiences transition back to life and society by identifying their unique circumstances and needs following suicide experiences; and 3) refine clinicians’ approaches to suicidal populations by explaining variation within the suicidal population across social identities. If, as evidence suggests, suicide survivors’ experiences and cultural narratives vary across social positions then these findings will have the potential to contribute to tailored suicide prevention policy and post-suicide programming, which could both save lives from suicide and improve survivors’ quality of life post-suicide experience. <br/> <br/>Understanding how people experience surviving suicide is critical to enhance suicide prevention efforts as well as to proving support to suicide survivors. Using in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 120 suicide survivors, this project will examine how individuals’ social identities—and the salience of those identities—affect how they make sense of their suicide experiences and how these framings relate to their transitions back to life after periods of suicidal ideation or suicide attempt(s). Interview data will be analyzed using a grounded theory approach with Max QDA, a software program that allows for sorting, coding, and organizing narrative interview data. Given the paucity of qualitative work on suicide, this project is both methodologically and theoretically novel. The qualitative approach will advance contemporary sociological theory about suicide and provide information about the social mechanisms through which social categories relate to suicide experiences. More broadly the project contributes to sociological theories related to health disparities that vary by social status.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result, high frequency signals on the nanowire experience significant spatial compression as well as a significant reduction in their velocity. The kinetic inductance also varies nonlinearly as a function of the current, creating an opportunity for realizing nonlinear phenomena with extremely minimal dissipation. Through a combination of theory, modeling, and experiment, this project will study these effects in different superconducting nanowire materials and geometries. The understanding gained from these studies will be applied to design new types of ultra-compact microwave devices, which will then be fabricated and characterized. Such devices can serve as important building blocks for the development of more complex systems based on superconducting circuits such as single-photon imagers and quantum computers. This collaborative project brings together groups at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of North Florida, an undergraduate-education focused university, to conduct the proposed research and educational activities, combining the best aspects of both institutions. In particular, the involvement of the University of North Florida creates additional opportunities for undergraduates from diverse backgrounds to participate in the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to create a new superconducting nanowire device platform that can serve as the basis of a monolithic superconducting nanowire microwave integrated circuit technology. This goal will be pursued through four approaches. The first approach is based on exploring materials and geometries that maximize the nanowire's kinetic inductivity, which will result in extremely large characteristic impedances (&gt; 10 kohm) along with slow signal velocities and large spatial compression of the signal wavelengths. Such high impedances create strong decoupling from the environment and have potential applications ranging from the readout of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors to the design of quantum bits. The second approach will be to fabricate nanowires on extremely high permittivity substrates such as strontium titanate, which has been shown to have a relative permittivity as high as 10,000 at low temperature. This extremely large permittivity will significantly boost the capacitance, bringing the characteristic impedance of high-inductance nanowires close to 50 kohm while simultaneously achieving ultra-slow signal velocities and ultra-compressed signal wavelengths. A 50 kohm impedance is critical to coupling with conventional microwave circuitry. The third approach will focus on understanding and exploiting the nonlinear current-dependence of kinetic inductance in order to create new types of nanowire-based nonlinear microwave devices. Examples of such devices include mixers, tunable couplers, switches, and parametric amplifiers. In order to understand these devices, the project will seek to address fundamental questions such as how quickly the nanowire's kinetic inductance can be modulated, how much loss is associated with this modulation, and how the nonlinearity and the loss depend on the signal power. The fourth approach will leverage the results generated in the first three approaches to develop more complex nanowire-based devices and circuits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PI plans to classify quantizations of equivariant covers of nilpotent orbits in classical Lie algebras and use this classification to solve several important problems in Lie representation theory. The PI also plans to classify certain interesting Harish-Chandra modules. The second part concentrates on the study of the representation theory of double affine type including that of the rational Cherednik algebras over fields of large positive characteristic and of quantum affine algebras of type A.

This international meeting on geometric group theory is expected to have about 80-85 participants. The organizers will make a special effort to include a diverse group of graduate students and postdocs, and the program will incorporate mechanisms for encouraging their interaction with more established mathematicians. The subject of the conference can be broadly described as using geometric methods to study algebraic objects. More specifically, the idea is to study groups by realizing them as groups of symmetries of some space, then to use geometric features of the space such as curvature to draw conclusions about the group. This subject, called geometric group theory, has expanded dramatically in recent years and is now a major current in mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will highlight the interaction between two main themes in geometric group theory: Artin groups on the one hand, and CAT(0) geometry on the other. Perhaps the most well-known examples of Artin groups are the braid groups. The study of Artin groups touches on many different fields, including low-dimensional topology, singularity theory, algebraic topology, and mathematical physics. CAT(0) spaces were introduced as a synthetic analog of non-positively curved manifolds. The symmetry groups of CAT(0) spaces turn out to have strong algebraic properties, making them an ideal tool for geometric group theory. Although Artin groups and CAT(0) geometry and their strong relationship will be the unifying theme of the conference, related topics such as Coxeter groups, three-dimensional manifolds, automorphisms of free groups, and mapping class groups will also be included in order to enrich exchanges between participants and inspire ideas for new research projects.

2001641.xml,Collaborative Research: Digitization PEN: Expanding and enhancing the California Phenology TCN,NSF,2020-09-15,2024-08-31,15301,"Flowering time is an important biological phenomenon, affecting human societies through its effects on agricultural crops, pollinators, pests, and biodiversity. Given the sensitivity of flowering times to climatic conditions, a thorough understanding of how plants respond to changing environments is necessary for predicting the consequences for pollinators, herbivores, parasites, and plant populations. A record of historical flowering times is found within the nation's herbaria – collections of dried and pressed plants. In 2018, the California Phenology Thematic Collections Network (CAP-TCN) was established to advance our understanding of flowering time changes over time. The network brought together 22 California universities, research stations, natural history collections, and botanical gardens, with the goal of imaging and recording the flowering status of approximately one million herbarium specimens collected over the past 150 years. These data are freely available through the newly established Consortium of California Herbaria (CCH2) portal. This project will add a partnership of seven new collections and six new institutions to the CAP-TCN, contributing an additional 150,000 herbarium specimens. The project participants will be fully integrated into CAP-TCN training and outreach activities including Notes from Nature online expeditions, which educate and involve members of the public in learning about herbarium specimens and flowering phenology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By expanding the geographic scope to encompass Oregon and the northern Baja California peninsula, the CAP-TCN will now cover the entire California Floristic Province, a biodiversity hotspot of global significance. This will increase the number of species with imaged specimens across their entire range from 1,217 to 1,850, a 55% increase. The addition of 80,000 Oregon and Baja California specimens to CCH2 will facilitate efficient specimen-based analyses of the entire California Floristic Province and for the first time allow a more objective and reproducible specimen-based delineation of its geographic boundaries. Three institutions in California and Nevada will fill key geographic gaps for northwestern California, the northern San Joaquin Valley, and the Mojave Desert. Two additional institutions will significantly increase CAP-TCN representation of 1) the ecologically important and taxonomically complex genus Arctostaphylos (manzanita); and 2) introduced and invasive species of importance to California agriculture, rangelands, and native ecosystems. An estimated 25 additional undergraduates will participate in digitizing activities. Ongoing public outreach efforts about the floras of Oregon and Baja California at Oregon State University and the San Diego Natural History Museum will also benefit from the newly imaged specimens.  Data will be shared through online resources, including iDigBio.org.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000469.xml,"Collagen fibril structure, surface charge and vascular calcification",NSF,2020-06-01,2025-05-31,454007,"Calcification of soft tissues (e.g. arteries) is a hallmark of several cardiovascular diseases like aortic aneurysms and atherosclerosis. Calcific deposits lead to adverse consequences such as stiffening of arteries and disruption of normal blood flow, often leading to morbidity and mortality. The goal of this project is to understand where calcific deposits are formed in soft tissues. In particular, the investigators will examine how collagen fibrils (present in the extracellular matrix surrounding the cells in the arterial wall) can facilitate pathological calcification. The insights gained will advance our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms governing soft-tissue calcification especially in its early stages. This can help improve cardiovascular outcomes by designing new strategies for early diagnosis and treatment and aid biomaterials development for cardiovascular bioprostheses. In addition to advancing the field of extracellular matrix and vascular biology, the project will help train the next generation of scientists and engineers by providing graduate and undergraduate student(s) with multidisciplinary hands-on research experiences and under-privileged K-8 students with enrichment activities. Furthermore, new education materials and microscopy approaches will be developed to enhance education and research infrastructure for the broader scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to understand the role of the collagen fibril in mediating vascular calcification.  While it is accepted that pathological calcification is mediated by phenotypic switching of vascular smooth muscle cells into a ‘bone-like’ osteogenic phenotype, there is also evidence indicating that in abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), a subpopulation of collagen fibrils in the extracellular matrix undergoes a structural change as compared to the native (normal) fibrils. The project’s overall hypothesis is that structurally altered (abnormal) collagen fibrils in AAA serve as the major substrates for calcific deposits due to perturbations in their surface-charge distribution. To test this hypothesis, studies will be conducted at the single fibril level on human AAA tissue, beginning with mapping the micro and macro-calcifications in the excised AAA tissue using micro-computed tomography. The Research Plan is organized under two aims.  The FIRST Aim is to test the hypothesis that structurally altered collagen fibrils in AAA are “hot-spots” for negative charges in the ECM.  Surface potential and surface charge mapping of collagen fibrils in ambient air will be accomplished using Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), a technique available on most commercial AFMs (Atomic Force Microscopes) that has been used for mapping surface potential and surface charge on metals and semiconductors, but is being uniquely applied in this project to the analysis of normal and abnormal fibrils in situ in tissue sections.  Surface charge distribution of collagen fibrils in a fluid environment will be measured using another AFM based approach based on recording force-distance curves, which can map both surface charge and sample topography at high resolution in physiologically relevant fluid environments (e.g. different salt concentrations).  The SECOND AIM is to test the hypothesis that both natural as well as bio-mimetically induced calcific deposits in AAA are localized on structurally altered fibrils. A biomimetic approach will be used to determine if abnormal fibrils can be a cause as well as an effect of vascular calcification. Biomimetic mineralization will be induced in a cell free manner (in mineral-poor regions) using ionic solutions (e.g. dental fluid) that mimic the native ion concentrations in plasma without its biological components and by incubating extracellular vesicles (EV) isolated from cultured cells with decellularized AAA tissue.  Spatial distribution and characterization of calcific deposits will be determined using analytical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) approaches to characterize the size, composition and location of minerals with respect to the collagen fibril at the ultrastructural level.  Abnormal fibrils are expected to be more prone to calcific deposits as compared to normal fibrils both with respect to percent of fibrils mineralized as well as number and size of calcific deposits present per fibril, and a similar trend is expected to be observed for biomimetic and naturally induced calcific deposits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2000187.xml,Excellence in Research: Collaborative Research:  Real-time Fault Diagnosis for Self-Driving Vehicles,NSF,2020-06-01,2025-05-31,190000,"By 2025, driverless cars will be an integral part of daily transportation. Understanding the reliability of self-driving cars is a crucial step to ensuring that the impending ubiquity of self-driving cars causes as few fatalities as possible. Components like actuators, sensors, and computational elements that make up such systems have inherent vulnerabilities to faults due to manufacturing defects, aging, cyberattacks, and environmental factors. Repair and replacement of such components may reduce the risk of fault occurrences, but may be infeasible in terms of cost, safety, and availability. Alternately, certain faults and their false positives may trigger unnecessary repair or cause unnecessary reactions by the vehicle. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly and accurately identify faults in real time. This research will facilitate the development of in-the-field error mitigation techniques, resulting in more reliable autonomous cars. Furthermore, this research will support the technical development and engagement of an underrepresented cohort of graduate and undergraduate students at North Carolina A&T State University and North Carolina Central University through curriculum enhancements and participation in extracurricular activities such as the AutoDrive Challenge, a national self-driving car competition.<br/><br/>The proposed work will provide real-time diagnosis of transient, intermittent, and permanent faults that occur in a self-driving car. This analysis will substantially improve the performance and accuracy of fault classification/identification in complex systems. Multi-perspective error detection techniques, including discrete-event system analysis, data-driven analysis, and chip-level analysis, will be combined to diagnose faults in automotive systems. The discrete-event system analysis will detect and isolate a system's fault occurrences from external observation of general behaviors of the system and in the absence of full observation of occurred events. The data-driven analysis will use a novel fuzzy type-2 clustering-based method to detect whether a fault degraded performance. The chip-level analysis will detect when a computational component is malfunctioning based on equivalence checking of logic signals and state traces. The combination of these approaches will facilitate fault diagnosis of automotive systems in real-time and with greater accuracy and speed. The multi-perspective analysis will improve the understanding of how each perspective interacts with the other and has the potential to identify new fault types and patterns. The enhanced awareness created by integrating these three unique methods will facilitate automotive system fault diagnosis in real time with greater accuracy and speed than could be achieved by any of the methods individually.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The platform is scalable in both synthesis and deployment, has a low environmental footprint, and it is flexible and cost-effective.  Remediation of oil and metal pollution is an ongoing and critical concern for environmental and human health. This flexible platform has the potential to solve these challenges. Initial commercialization targets are the shipping, marine, and tourism sectors, &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will determine potential use cases for safe polymer-coated and magnetic nanomaterials based on low-cost, easily available and low toxicity chemicals. Simple and rapid sorption reactions govern oil and metal removal, and the nanomaterials are protected from transformations long enough to effectively perform their function. Sorbed metal/oil is less toxic, and magnetic nanomaterials allow easy separation of sorbed pollutants from the environment.

2000638.xml,Collaborative Research: Exploring Algorithmic Fairness and Potential Bias in K-12 Mathematics Adaptive Learning,NSF,2020-10-01,2024-09-30,987015,"Students in middle school and high school often use adaptive learning software as part of their math education experience. Adaptive learning software works by automatically measuring how much students have learned about the topic, as well as their learning process and experiences, and then adjusting the instruction accordingly. This project will investigate potential ways in which adaptive learning software might be biased against students from certain groups, and how such biases can be reduced. Adaptive learning offers an opportunity to provide high quality instruction that is personalized to the needs of individual learners, but little is known about who benefits most from adaptive learning technologies. This project will address this issue by observing and interviewing students who use adaptive math learning software to discover what aspects of their identity are most salient in the adaptive learning context. This project will then investigate possible algorithmic biases related to the identities that students express. Findings from the project will contribute to understanding of the most relevant aspects of student identity in adaptive learning contexts, and how those identities affect their learning experience. Finally, this project will address the biases that are identified, thereby providing a more equitable mathematics education experience for students.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern adaptive learning platforms individualize learning support and improve learner outcomes by using algorithms that are typically derived through machine learning. Previous work has studied biases in educational model accuracy for large groups (e.g., ethnic and gendered categories, urban vs. rural, etc.); however, large groups may have a great deal of heterogeneity, and little is known about which specific groups of students suffer from biases in model accuracy and why. This project will approach the problem of potential bias in three steps. First, the project will begin by collecting data on educational software usage patterns (i.e., logs of actions and classroom observations of student experiences) for students using MATHia, a math education platform used by over half a million students across the United States. As part of this data collection, students will describe their identity in open-ended survey responses and interviews, which will be analyzed to discover identity characteristics that shape their learning experiences. Second, existing machine learning models will be applied to these data to predict knowledge, engagement, and self-regulated learning behaviors, and the predictions will be analyzed to reveal cases where models are systematically biased. Third, the project will compare various pre-processing, in-processing, and post- processing methods for bias reduction, and study the effects of the improved algorithms when applied in MATHia. Results from this project will contribute to scientific understanding of the role of student identity in adaptive learning software, biases in machine learning for educational software, and the effects of applying machine learning methods for bias reduction.

A major open problem in this field is to determine when these solution spaces can be parametrized by independent variables; it can be done for linear or quadratic equations, but is already unknown in degree three. Such algebraic questions have wide-ranging applications, e.g., in data science, optimization, or robotics.

2000995.xml,COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: Orbital-scale Variability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and the Formation of Bottom Water in the Ross Sea during the Pliocene-Pleistocene,NSF,2020-09-01,2024-08-31,57598,"Part I: Non-technical description: &lt;br/&gt;Predicting how polar ice sheets will respond to future global warming is difficult because all the processes that contribute to their melting are not well understood. This is important because the more ice on land that melts, the higher sea levels will rise. The most significant uncertainty in current estimates of sea-level rise in the coming decades is the potential contribution from the Antarctic Ice Sheet. One way to increase our knowledge about how large ice sheets respond to climate change in response to natural factors is to examine the geologic past. Natural global warming (and cooling) events in Earth’s history provide examples that we can use to better understand processes, interactions, and responses we can’t directly observe today. One such time period, approximately three million years ago (known as the Pliocene), was the last time atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were as high as they are today and, therefore, represents a time period to study to better understand the ice sheet response to a warming climate. Specifically, this project is interested in understanding how ocean currents near Antarctica, which transport heat and store carbon, behaved during these past climate events. The history of past ice sheet-ocean interactions are recorded in sediments that were deposited, layer upon layer, in the deep sea offshore Antarctica. In January-February 2018, a team of scientists and crew set sail to the Ross Sea, offshore west Antarctica, on the scientific ocean drilling vessel JOIDES Resolution to recover such sediment archives. This project focuses on a sediment core from that expedition, which captures the relatively warm Pliocene time interval, as well as the subsequent transition into cooler climates typical of the past two million years. The researchers will analyze the sediment with multiple complementary measurements, including: grain size, composition, chemistry of organic matter, physical structures, microfossil type and abundance, and more. These analyses will be done by the research team, including several students, at their respective laboratories and will then integrated into a unified record of ice sheet-ocean interactions. Ultimately, the results will be used to improve modeled projections of how the Antarctic Ice Sheet could respond to future climate change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part II: Technical description: &lt;br/&gt;Geological records from the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) margin demonstrate that the ice sheet oscillated in response to orbital variations in insolation (i.e., ~400, 100, 41, and 20 kyr), and it appears to be more sensitive to specific frequencies that regulate mean annual insolation (i.e., 41-kyr obliquity), particularly when the ice sheet extends into marine environments and is impacted by ocean circulation. However, the relationship between orbital forcing and the production of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) is unconstrained. Thus, a knowledge gap exists in understanding how changing insolation impacts ice marginal and Southern Ocean conditions that directly influence ventilation of the global ocean. The researchers hypothesize that insolation-driven changes directly affected the production and export of AABW to the Southern Ocean from the Pliocene through the Pleistocene. For example, obliquity amplification during the warmer Pliocene may have led to enhanced production and export of dense waters from the shelf due to reduced AIS extent, which, in turn, led to greater AABW outflow. To determine the relationship of AABW production to orbital regime, they plan to reconstruct both from a single, continuous record from the levee of Hillary Canyon, a major conduit of AABW outflow, on the Ross Sea continental rise. To test their hypothesis, they will analyze sediment from IODP Site U1524 (recovered in 2018 during International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 374) and focus on three data sets. (1) They will use the occurrence, frequency, and character of mm-scale turbidite beds as a proxy of dense-shelf-water cascading outflow and AABW production. They will estimate the down-slope flux via numerical modeling of turbidity current properties using morphology, grain size, and bed thickness as input parameters. (2) They will use grain-size data, physical properties, XRF core scanning, CT imaging, and hyperspectral imaging to guide lithofacies analysis to infer processes occurring during glacial, deglacial, and interglacial periods. Statistical techniques and optimization methods will be applied to test for astronomical forcing of sedimentary packages in order to provide a cyclostratigraphic framework and interpret the orbital-forcing regime. (3) They will use bulk sedimentary carbon and nitrogen abundance and isotope data to determine how relative contributions of terrigenous and marine organic matter change in response to orbital forcing. All of these data will be integrated with sedimentological records to deconvolve organic matter production from its deposition or remobilization due to AABW outflow as a function of the oscillating extent of the AIS. These data sets will be integrated into a unified chronostratigraphy to determine the relationship between AABW outflow and orbital-forcing scenarios under the varying climate regimes of the Plio-Pleistocene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Not only on the surface, water (hydrogen) is present inside of Earth and slowly circulates. This global water circulation creates and maintains oceans on Earth. Based on a number of studies during the last a few decades, there is a clear idea about the water circulation in the shallow part of Earth’s interior. However, the nature of water circulation in the largest part of the mantle, the lower mantle, remains poorly constrained. A key in the global water circulation is the role of melting. Melting removes water from minerals to melt, and melt migrates a long distance to cause large-scale water transport. However, the nature of global water circulation in the deep mantle is very poorly understood mainly because our understanding of water in the minerals in the deep mantle is limited.  The PI team will bring together a suite of theoretical and experimental methods to address these questions, and will train both graduate and undergraduate students at three institutions on a cross-cutting research project.  The PIs will also engage in public outreach events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this new project, the water solubility in bridgmanite (dominant lower mantle mineral) will be determined under the shallow lower mantle conditions from ~660 km to ~1000 km depth, and also the role of water (hydrogen) on electrical conductivity in bridgmanite will be investigated. Experimental studies will be made on clean single crystals of bridgmanite and the hydrogen content and solubility mechanisms will be studied using FTIR and SIMS. Electrical conductivity will be measured on these samples for different orientations using the AC impedance spectroscopy. First-principle computational studies will also be made on hydrogen solubility and mobility in bridgmanite to help interpreting the experimental results. These results will help us to develop a model of global water circulation and to test models against geophysical estimates of water distribution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The use of modern Accelerator Mass Spectrometry radiocarbon, Optical Stimulated Luminescence, and Terrestrial Cosmogenic dating methods in conjunction with paleoearthquake trenching investigations proposed herein will yield observations to 1) assess the northward extent to which slip rate is elevated along the Central Nevada Seismic Belt within the interior of the Basin and Range, 2) to determine whether the past history of events in Pleasant Valley exhibits repeated clustering of events that is observed in the Central Nevada Seismic Belt to the south, 3) address whether or not strands of the 1915 rupture separated by a 4 kilometer step in trace exhibited the same behavior in past earthquakes, 4) compare geologic rates of slip during the late Pleistocene as compared to modern geodesy, 5) cross-check multiple dating techniques applied to the same sediments, and 6) develop quantitative constraints on the timing of alluvial fan deposition in Pleasant Valley as a possible tool for assessing fault slip rates on adjacent range fronts exhibiting the same geomorphic and soil characteristics. In sum, there are few continental normal fault earthquake ruptures on which to gather observations bearing on the characteristics of rupture and recurrence. This study will provide the basis to compare and contrast characteristics of the 1915 ruptures to those that occurred before, both on the 1915 fault and elsewhere around the globe.

Specifically, existing proxy climate records will be used to produce new robust and unbiased syntheses of rainfall and sea-surface temperature changes during three different past intervals when the North Atlantic abruptly cooled and compare them against new and existing climate model simulations with the objective of testing the dominant mechanisms driving the tropical response to hemispheric forcing. These mechanisms will be contrasted with the responses to other hemispheric forcings, anthropogenic aerosols and volcanic eruptions, to assess their roles, and therefore improve the confidence of climate variability model predictions. The research has the potential to produce a complete theory of how the global tropics respond to North Atlantic cooling. This theory will provide a more complete understanding of the processes that give rise to inter-hemispheric asymmetries in tropical climate - one of the first order features of the Earth’s climate, as well as its response to climatic perturbations with inter-hemispheric asymmetries, such as anthropogenic aerosols, volcanic eruptions, or arctic sea ice loss. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential Broader Impacts include advancing theoretical understanding of the mechanisms underlying climate perturbations transmitted through the tropics which has the potential to improve model predictions to a range of climate forcings, and more specifically, predictions of changes in tropical rainfall in heavily populated areas (the Americas, Africa, Asia). The data synthesis as well as model simulation will be made publicly available for the broad paleoclimate community as well as local students. Other Broader Impacts include training the next generation of climate researchers through the research framework developed in this project that will be incorporated in the researcher’s teaching activities. In addition, the researchers will be involved in outreach activities (Tournament of Science Olympiad) with the goal to advance climate system literacy in high school education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001403.xml,Collaborative Research: The Nonlinear Stochastic Dynamics of Micro and Nanomechanical Systems,NSF,2020-06-15,2025-11-30,361334,"Technology continues to make great strides at the nanoscale, resulting in unprecedented capabilities.  Currently, thermal fluctuations have not driven nano systems outside their linear regime where their dynamics are well understood.  However, as mechanical systems are made smaller for next-generation technologies, their performance is becoming limited by the random thermal movements of the molecules that make up the device and surrounding medium as the thermal fluctuations are becoming sufficient to drive the mechanical system into a nonlinear regime.  Developing an understanding of the fluctuations of nano mechanical systems in this nonlinear regime is the focus of this work.  Three-dimensional nanoprinting will be employed to create structures designed to study nonlinear behavior when driven by the temperature alone.  A theoretical understanding of the nonlinear behavior will be created by utilizing the fundamental relationship between the fluctuations and the dissipation present in the system.  The findings will provide the insights necessary to realize the next generation of nanotechnology where performance is anticipated to be well beyond the current state-of-the art.<br/><br/>The stochastic dynamics of nanoscale systems are at the heart of many important phenomena.  Currently, there is a good understanding of stochastic dynamics when a mechanical system remains in the linear regime.  However, many important challenges remain in understanding nonlinear fluctuations of nanomechanical systems.  In order to build this understanding, state-of-the-art nanofabrication and measurement approaches, coupled with the development of analytical and numerical methods to describe and predict these dynamics, will be utilized.  A direct laser write system will be used to fabricate structures tailored to exhibit highly nonlinear stochastic dynamics when driven by temperature alone.  The nonlinear stochastic dynamics of structures constructed from soft polymeric materials will be experimentally studied using measurements from a heterodyne interferometer.  A physical understanding of the system dynamics will be built using the powerful fluctuation-dissipation theorem.  The dynamics will be probed perturbatively and a factorization approach will be used to create a deterministic approach to describe the dynamics of strongly nonlinear systems.  After developing an understanding of the nonlinear fluctuations of a single mode of oscillation, the coupling between the different modes of oscillation of a complex structure will be investigated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2003110.xml,Nonlocal and Stochastic Effects in Reaction-Diffusion and Kinetic Equations.,NSF,2019-09-01,2023-06-30,111085,"In many large-scale systems, given an initial configuration (of particles, individuals, temperature, etc.) there is a trend toward a predictable state that can be described qualitatively or quantitatively.  These systems arise in a wide variety of contexts in the physical, biological, and social sciences as well as engineering, and this project focuses on the mathematical study of such long-time behavior in a variety of models with a specific focus on those arising in plasma physics, turbulent combustion, and population dynamics.  Two major fundamental challenges in the models considered are the existence of multiple temporal and spatial scales and nonlocal interactions.  The former requires developing an understanding of how small-scale oscillations ""average out"" over long time scales; for instance, in flame propagation, a ""small"" random drift produces fluctuations of the front whose statistics are given by limiting stochastic equation.  The latter requires determining the impact of complex long-range interactions.  A typical example considered in this project is the influence of chemotaxis (which is the phenomenon in which each individual bacterium ""senses"" other bacteria and moves towards the population center) on bacterial invasions.  In both cases, the aim is to determine which features of the systems are predictable and under what conditions such predictions hold.  Various educational activities, including the training of young researchers at the undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate level, are planned.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to develop technical tools that allow to better characterize the effects of stochastic fluctuations of the environment and nonlocal interactions between individuals affects the long-time behavior of solutions to several reaction-diffusion, Hamilton-Jacobi, and kinetic equations.  The project breaks down into two major portions.  The first encompasses front propagation problems in which a moving interface separating two states emerges.  The shape and dynamics of this interface are strongly related to the fluctuations of the media and to internal interactions.  The second is the regularity and boundedness of kinetic models coming from plasma physics.  New estimates of solutions to these equations continue to emerge via the application of ideas from the parabolic theory.  The goal is to combine these ideas with a precise understanding of nonlocal effects in order to weaken current restrictions on the well-posedness theory and develop physically reasonable conditions under which blow-up is prevented.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000511.xml,"STEM Literacies, Learning, and Identities through Cascading Models of Near-Peer Mentorship",NSF,2020-06-01,2025-05-31,1155005,"Despite decades-long efforts to broaden STEM participation, the underrepresentation of people from communities of color persists in STEM across many areas, including, for example, laboratory work, engineering, and teaching. Research suggests that more expansive STEM learning opportunities are possible in school and out of school when youth have opportunities to develop and share their experience with others, both in and beyond the classroom. Mentoring is a widely accepted strategy for supporting youth learning and identity development across a variety of sectors including education and workforce development. There is broad concern, however, that more empirical research needs to be done, especially related to middle school and high school youth in STEM. Young people can be effective leaders in both formal and informal learning contexts and such mentorship and pedagogy can lead to STEM learning and positive identity development with implications for broadening participation. In formal and informal contexts, having youth act in facilitator roles holds promise for identification with engaging in STEM content and practices. As such, this project investigates the ways in which young people construct and develop affiliations with STEM in their capacity as mentors, facilitators, and curators of STEM ideas and practices among younger youth. Additionally, the project outcomes seek to understand the design of formal and informal learning environments that support STEM identity development for youth of color by orienting to youth as knowledgeable experts and focusing on youth's ongoing pedagogical development as mentors in STEM.<br/> <br/>In partnership with two informal and two formal learning partners in the Boston area, this project will work with 140 young people, aged 14-24, 96% from communities of color, who participate in activities related to youth mentoring initiatives in STEM areas. These partners have a rich history of initiatives focused on developing high school and college youth mentors to work in STEM summer camps and juniors and seniors in high school to mentor freshmen and sophomores in mathematics and digital fabrication engineering. The project intends to investigate how youth mentors teach, where they are successful and where they need support, and to develop principles for professional learning opportunities for schools and out-of-school organizations. The project focuses, in particular, on understanding “youth pedagogical development” (YPD), or youth’s ongoing process of learning to be mentors. Exploring YPD involves understanding youth’s learning of STEM ideas, literacies, and pedagogical strategies and how youth come to identify with STEM and STEM mentoring. Youth mentors can reach large numbers of learners, and more importantly they can connect deeply with other youth in meaningful ways. This participatory project draws on ethnographic and case study methods and employs areas of work shown to support broadening participation in STEM: a) prior research on youth as mentors in STEM learning; b) distributions of power and authority in formal and informal learning contexts; c) academic identity development; and d) STEM literacies. By collecting and analyzing data from four different contexts with organizations that have shared values and practices, including distributed authority for knowing, the partnership intends to understand program design principles that support students as mentors in regard to STEM literacies, learning, identity development, and pedagogy. By following youth mentors over two years, the case studies will highlight how STEM learning, identity building, and pedagogy are developed when youth participate as mentors in sustained ways over longer stretches of time. In addition to disseminating this work at academic conferences, the project will have a website that will be useful to other community groups and schools that utilize mentoring practices and will host a conference that will involve all partner organizations as well as groups from around the US who use mentoring to support STEM learning and identity development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On the other hand, algebraic geometry is based on the use of abstract algebraic techniques, mainly from commutative algebra, for solving geometric problems about the sets of zeros of multivariable polynomials. The research supported by this NSF award is at the crossroads of representation theory and algebraic geometry, to use representation theory to solve geometric problems and to use geometric methods to understand representation theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research projects center on two main themes. In the first, the PI will develop a theory of conformal blocks for general parahoric group schemes over curves. The research will focus on Pappas-Rapoport conjecture, vanishing conjecture and Verlinde formula for twisted conformal blocks. This will lead to applications in orbifold conformal field theory and geometric Langlands program for parahoric group schemes. For the second theme, the PI will develop connections between the geometry of twisted affine Grassmannian and representation theory.  The geometry of affine Grassmannians can be related to Kac-Moody theory, representation theory of reductive groups and their bases via geometric Satake correspondence, and it also plays crucial role in symplectic duality. The research along this direction will advance the role of twisted affine Grassmannians in Kac-Moody theory, ramified geometric Satake, symplectic duality, and a connection with Springer theory for symmetric spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002991.xml,Tie Chains in Semicrystalline Homopolymers and Copolymers,NSF,2020-08-01,2025-07-31,640000,"PART 1:  NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Why is paraffin wax brittle, while the polymer used in hip replacements is tough and durable?  Both are hydrocarbon chain molecules -- varieties of ""polyethylene"".  The key difference is that the material used in hip replacements (along with other varieties of polyethylene used in durable gas and water pipes) contains molecular chains which are long enough to span between the microscopic crystals of the material, creating “tie chains” that hold the material together.  While this example shows clearly that polymers need to be above a certain chain length to possess toughness and ductility, surprisingly it is not known ""how long is long enough?"" -- a threshold which also depends on microstructural features of the material, such as the distance separating those microscopic crystals.  This project will establish quantitative criteria for ductility in semicrystalline polymers, by synthesizing polymers of tightly-controlled chain length and molecular structure, and will also investigate how these tie molecules change shape when the material deforms.  These quantitative criteria will aid the design and processing of optimized semicrystalline polymers (of which polyethylene is just one example): e.g., where the polymer chains are long enough that the material does not fracture or fragment during use, but short enough that the material can be processed using a minimum of energy.  The project will provide an integrated research and educational experience for graduate students, undergraduate students, and high-school students, including members of underrepresented groups.  The principal investigator and students will also engage the general public through science outreach at broadly-advertised events, both on campus and off.  <br/><br/><br/>PART 2:  TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Semicrystalline polymers derive their ductility and toughness from tie chains:  molecules sufficiently long that they can bridge two or more crystals.  Despite this qualitative understanding, today we do not know a priori the minimum macromolecular size needed to impart ductility to a semicrystalline polymer, even if all aspects of its solid-state structure (such as the crystallite and amorphous layer thicknesses) are known.  This project will use recently-developed ring-opening metathesis polymerization routes to synthesize well-defined semicrystalline homopolymers, statistical copolymers, and block copolymers, based on linear polyethylene and hydrogenated polynorbornene.  In one thrust, examination of linear homopolymers by small-angle neutron scattering will allow an assessment of the macromolecular (single-chain) deformation which occurs in tie chains beyond the yield point.  In a second thrust, systematic examination of homopolymers and statistical copolymers as molecular weight and noncrystallizable comonomer content are tuned will allow us to elucidate the structural features required for ductility.  Finally, we will build on this knowledge to simultaneously raise these polymers' yield strengths into the range of structural (engineering) plastics via incorporation of a short glassy block, while retaining ductility. Students will work  across all phases of the project, from synthesis to characterization to property measurement, gaining a big-picture outlook which will serve them well as a future foundation.  Project participants will engage the general public at broadly-advertised public outreach events, with a focus on polymeric materials science and technology.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Symmetry can be described mathematically through motions, for example, a rotation after which the object appears the same. Such motions collectively form what is called a symmetry group. In quantum physics, this classical notion of symmetry group is no longer enough to capture all symmetries and is replaced by a notion more suited to quantum phenomena, termed quantum symmetry groups, or by related more general mathematical structures. This project carries out basic research in quantum symmetry, which is important in current applications of mathematics such as quantum computing and quantum information science. The project aims to develop and apply techniques for breaking down instances of quantum symmetry into smaller components, facilitating understanding. This work will expand the techniques available for answering questions about quantum symmetry that arise in applications. The project involves training of students through research involvement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum groups, noncommutative algebras, and tensor categories are the settings for quantum symmetry studied in this project, which uses homological techniques to shed light on their structure. The research involves several directions. The investigator will study the cohomology of Hopf algebras and tensor categories, specifically to investigate a conjecture that cohomology of finite tensor categories is always finitely generated. The investigator aims to establish results on the structure of support varieties for finite tensor categories, harnessing homological techniques combined with geometry to obtain information such as a tensor product property and criteria for wild representation type. She plans to establish a direct connection between two different techniques that were developed recently, the homotopy lifting method and loops in exact categories, calling on techniques used in connection with A-infinity structures. She will also continue to develop improved techniques for understanding the Lie structure of the Hochschild cohomology of twisted tensor product algebras, particularly skew group algebras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The atmosphere converts pollutants by processing them into water-soluble products that are removed through precipitation (rain or snow) or by deposition onto Earth’s surface. This chemical conversion of pollution happens through a sunlight-driven (photochemical) process known as oxidation. Most of what is known about these atmospheric processes comes from measurements made at the surface in Arctic coastal environments. The CHACHA team plans to use two instrumented aircraft to conduct airborne measurements around the Chukchi Sea, the Beaufort Sea, and the Alaska North Slope region. They plan to target features that are rapidly changing - above and downwind of sea ice ""leads"" (areas of open water in otherwise sea-ice-covered ocean regions), and downwind of sources of combustion-derived pollutants. Researchers will also use collected data to develop atmospheric models that will be openly available for use by the broader scientific community. The team is composed of researchers at six United States universities (in Alaska, Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and New York) and will mentor a diverse group of students and postdoctoral scholars. Researchers will also engage in several additional education and outreach activities, including an “aircraft open house” and an annual three-day Science Fair in Utqiaġvik, AK. Overall, this project will enable the United States to better understand how rapid change in the Arctic impacts the chemical composition of the atmosphere and to translate what was learned to other regions - including the atmosphere above the world's oceans and in Earth's upper atmosphere.

Aircraft will conduct complementary sampling upwind and downwind of leads (sea ice fractures), over snow-covered tundra, and downwind of the North Slope of Alaska oilfields. Sampling will occur at various altitudes from the near-surface through the boundary layer and into the free troposphere. The team will prioritize measurement of various greenhouse gases (including O3, CO2, CH4, H2O), reactive trace gases (including NO2, SO2, N2O5, HO2NO2, bromine- and chlorine-containing gases), aerosol size distributions and composition, cloud residual particle composition, and cloud particle size distributions, as well as atmospheric data.

An L-function is a special kind of function that packages together information about an arithmetical object that arises from studying it modulo p for each prime p. For instance, the Riemann zeta function is the simplest example of an L-function and has proven to be indispensable in studying the distribution of the prime numbers.  Other types of L-functions are crucial for understanding if certain polynomial equations have solutions, or more generally, how many solutions there are. Often these questions are related to how large the L-function is at a special point.  Much of this project concerns the development of new tools for studying how L-functions may fit into families and using these tools to better understand individual L-functions. The investigator will continue to advise PhD students and to mentor and collaborate with undergraduate students, especially through the Texas A&amp;M Research Experience for Undergraduates.  This type of mentorship is invaluable in preparing students for graduate studies, particularly for undergraduate students from non-PhD granting institutions as well as from population groups underrepresented in STEM fields.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will study new families of L-functions and use them as tools for estimating L-functions on the critical line.

Their evolution stretches 300 Mya and there are ~6200 known species found in nearly all parts of the world. They are central to understanding the evolution of flight, as their ancestors were among the first animals to fly. While flight evolved early, they are remarkable aerial ambush predators serving a key ecological role in communities as predators on other insects such as biting flies (e.g., mosquitoes). Odonates are also one of a few animal groups that spend part of their life in freshwater and another part on land, and so they are key indicators of healthy freshwater systems. They have received much scientific interest, but information about their genealogy, ecology, and distribution is not centralized in any one source. This research is important because it will gather this information for nearly all species and put it in an online database that is available to both the public and researchers. This will be the first such database for an entire order of insect. It will allow dragonflies and damselflies to be used more in environmental, ecological, and evolutionary studies.

It will amass phylogenetic, ecological and geospatial data, making this available for the wider scientific community via the OdonataCentral website. Secondly, this data will be used to study the historical impact of mobility, habitat, niche, color, and distribution on odonate diversification and diversity patterns at the global level. The project will bring together leaders in Odonata phylogenetics, ecology, biogeography as well as informatics and citizen science, and will: (1) develop a robust, species-level molecular and morphological phylogeny of extant and fossil Odonata; (2) amass ecological traits, especially rich information about dragon- and damselfly color, and develop full global distribution and  environmental niche information; (3) test evolutionary hypotheses regarding diversification of Odonata, especially the role of color evolution; (4) develop visualizations, knowledge products and analyses that dynamically integrate these three data layers while engaging the general public through museum, web- and mobile-app based tools and outreach.

By systematically optimizing sample additives and probe parameters for analysis of proteins in solution and on surfaces, Dr. Venter and his team is not only improving protein analysis, but is also adding to the fundamental understanding of protein solubility and stability, with important potential consequences for bioanalytical measurements, recombinant protein expression, and applications such as the development of protein therapeutics. Students participating in these studies learn about chemistry and biology.  In addition, Dr. Venter and colleagues bring the research topics into the classroom, including an unusual interdisciplinary course engaging aspiring scientists with students in the sonic and visual arts.  These exposures help prepare both groups for the interdisciplinary nature of STEAM - science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics - in contemporary society. <br/><br/>This research draws on the observation that adding serine either to the spray or to a deposited sample can enhance sensitivity in desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) mass spectrometric analysis of proteins.  The underlying mechanism is assessed by studying the effects of derivatization of the serine additive at all three reactive sites. Signals derived from protein monomers and aggregates in native and denatured states are monitored under basic, neutral, and acidic conditions to probe which functional groups and molecular properties drive protein dissolution and stability in solution. Drs. Venter and Barkman are also studying the efficacious effect of adding ethyl acetate vapor to the atmosphere surrounding the analyte, which has been found to increase protein signal intensities and reduce the abundance of spectral features derived from clusters. Better understanding of the mechanisms of these effects may enable novel high-throughput strategies for identification of proteins and their enzymatic functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A good number of the issues the PI plans to address are a natural continuation of problems he has explored recently that keep progressing and diffusing through a wider mathematical community. The questions to be studied have a certain universality in the sense that the same paradigm reappears from geometry and analysis, to fluid dynamics and material sciences, to financial mathematics and, more recently, biology and stochastic geometry. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first project concerns compressible flow (for instance, a gas) in porous media, in particular when the flow has a ""history"" that clogs with time the porous media (the Caputo diffusion model). Some important aspects of the Caputo diffusion model are being studied by the PI and an advanced graduate student, in particular when it occurs through two media with different porosity (transmission condition). Related mathematical phenomena concern the saline flow through semipermeable membranes (where the salt can flow only in one direction through the membrane). Another case where the flow is induced by global considerations concerns the quasi-geostrophic equation: this equation describes the evolution of the temperature on the surface of the ocean, and here temperature is influenced at a distance though the atmosphere. In collaboration with a graduate student the PI is working on the time evolution of this process in the land-sea interphase. Another interesting problem considered is concerned with ""overlapping"" interactions. An example is the structure of pricing for buying vs selling of goods. There is an area of ""values"" of the underlying good where the two prices diverge, and one where they come together. Mathematically, these are very interesting problems concerned with the stability of the configuration, in particular for the edge dividing one behavior from the other in a nonlinear way. In a different area, the PI is studying issues of segregation and predator-prey models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, instructional assistants are defined as undergraduate learning assistants and graduate teaching assistants who support student learning during problem solving in interactive lectures. Integrating instructional assistants into introductory gatekeeper courses contributes to increased student achievement and a decrease in failure rates in these courses and can be particularly beneficial for students from marginalized groups. However, not every instructional assistant-student interaction is effective. This foundational research will characterize interactive dynamics that are effective for student learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will use a sociocultural perspective to model four dimensions of instructional assistants’ facilitation practices: the nature of instructional assistant-student interactions, their purposes, in-the-moment learning that occurs, and the integration of the interactions into the whole class. The research will adapt the formative assessment enactment model that was developed to characterize K-12 teaching practices to model instructional assistant-student interactions. Practical epistemology analysis will be used to model students’ in-the-moment learning during interactions. The integration of interactions into the whole class will be characterized using cultural historical activity theory to relate instructional assistant-student interactions and whole class discussions. Multiple strands of data will be collected and qualitatively analyzed, including videos of instructional assistant-student interactions and interviews with professors, instructional assistants, and students. Results from this project will provide a theoretical basis to inform professional development for IAs and further systematic study of their practices.

When pores are connected, fluids can flow through them. Understanding and predicting fluid flow in porous media is important as it occurs in a wide range of applications, from contamination of groundwater and soil to printing on paper and fabrics. By understanding flow pathways, we can make accurate predictions of the fluid flow, which in turn, will help us design and control related processes. However, predicting fluid flow in porous media is still a long-standing problem. While observing fluid flow in simple two-dimensional porous media can be straightforward, the same is not true in more realistic three-dimensional cases. This proposal aims to carry out an integrated computational and experimental study to provide a more accurate description of flow pathways and realistic fluid flow and the resultant deformations in such materials. <br/><br/>Although non-destructive 3D imaging has provided much information about fluid distribution in porous materials, fast and cost-effective 4D pore-scale visualization (i.e., over a period of time) is still very difficult, costly and time-consuming. Furthermore, although visualization of multiphase flow in porous media has been extensively studied in 2D models, there have been very few of such studies in 4D (or even 3D). One goal of this proposal is to develop a 4D method for visualization of two-phase flow in transparent porous media and the deformation that it induces in the media beyond the realm of creeping flow, i.e. when the flow is very slow. This goal will be achieved by collecting 2D images from various angles, which will then be used with a computational algorithm to build a highly detailed 4D image of the multiphase flow. Detailed computations will be carried out in which the two-phase fluid flow and the resulting deformation will be simulated in the same porous media beyond creeping flow. The investigators will also study and identify the critical Reynolds number (Re) at which the transition from the Darcy regime to Forchheimer and eventually turbulent flows occurs. The effect of wettability on the deformation of porous media during two-phase flow will also be investigated. Distinct deformation modes of a porous medium will also be examined under a wide range of Reynolds number and wettability conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001314.xml,Collaborative Research: Developing New Models of Oceanic Magmatism and Source Heterogeneity Using the 8 degree 20' N Seamounts as Windows into the Sub-Ridge Mantle,NSF,2020-05-01,2023-10-31,256396,"Eruptions of lava form submarine volcanoes, known as seamounts, near mid-ocean ridge spreading centers. These lavas can provide important information about what Earth’s uppermost (~ 120 miles) mantle is composed of and how it melts to form the majority of Earth’s crust. At present no studies have examined long chains of seamounts adjacent to mid-ocean ridges to address these fundamental questions. In this study, we plan to analyze over 400 well located lava samples from the 8°20'N seamount chain. The chain was previously sampled and mapped in 2016 and 2018 using the submersible Alvin and autonomous vehicle Sentry. The geochemical, mineralogical, and age data to be obtained under this project will allow us to determine the origin of the magmas that feed the seamounts and nearby ridge. The data will also tell us how those magmas evolve to form oceanic lavas, and how the volcanism is related to regional tectonic processes.  The study will promote advances in the field of geochemistry, marine geology, and geodynamics. This project will provide significant mentorship and training for students at a variety of levels.  It will fully or partially support three graduate students at Florida and Boise State and will provide training for several undergraduates in geochemical techniques and interpretation, and support senior research projects. The project will also support education and diversity by funding two female scientists, one a first-generation college graduate, toward obtaining their PhDs in geochemistry. Both principal investigators are heavily involved in outreach and education at the K-12 levels in Florida and Idaho.<br/><br/>Sparse sampling and geochemical analyses of seamounts scattered throughout the northeastern Pacific suggest the sub-ridge mantle associated with the East Pacific Rise (EPR) has far greater compositional variability then is preserved in lavas erupted on-axis. While the relative homogeneity of axial lavas has resulted in intriguing generalizations about magma differentiation and mixing processes at mid-ocean ridges (MOR), seamount studies have had a significant impact on our understanding of the source compositions for oceanic basalts, the scales of mantle heterogeneity, and mantle melting systematics at MOR. However, many of these studies have focused on dredged lavas from individual seamounts with very few combining in situ sampling and high-resolution mapping from a single chain oriented perpendicular to the ridge axis.  To fill this gap in knowledge about the sub-ridge mantle, two research cruises in 2016 and 2018 investigated the 8°20’N seamount chain that extends ~200km west of the EPR.  The 8°20’N seamount chain was unexplored and virtually unsampled before our highly successful OASIS cruises. Geophysical, observational, and preliminary geochemical data from this nearly continuous chain of volcanoes led us to unexpected discoveries about their construction and revealed extreme compositional variability in the near MOR mantle that was previously only surmised from regional seamount studies in the northeast Pacific. The location, orientation, and preliminary data from the 8°20'N seamount chain make it an ideal a natural laboratory to investigate source heterogeneity and melting systematics in the near-ridge mantle. We propose to study the petrologic processes and mantle sources feeding MOR and near-axis volcanoes though comprehensive geochemical analyses of lavas and melt inclusions from the 8°20’N seamounts. Site-specific sampling using HOV Alvin and extensive, fine-scale mapping with AUV Sentry along the seamount chain, coupled with our previous comprehensive investigations of the 8°- 10°N EPR provide an exceptional opportunity to constrain geodynamic and geochemical models of mantle melting near MOR and determine the extent and length scales of mantle heterogeneity. We propose to collect a wide spectrum of petrologic and geochemical data including Sr, Nd, Pb, and Os isotopes, melt inclusion compositions, volatile contents, and 40Ar/39Ar age dates of lavas from the extensive collection of samples we have from the 8°20’N seamount chain. These results will be combined with numerical models to produce a petrologic model of mantle melting and magmatic processes in the near-ridge mantle. This extensive off-axis seamount chain provides a rare opportunity to probe the compositions of the mantle near MOR and to understand how magmas are spatially and temporally distributed in the shallow mantle and crust. Results from this research have implications for the generation of the majority of Earth’s crust.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Saccharides embedded in cell surfaces play critical roles in biology.  In humans, they are attached to soluble and membrane associated proteins and lipids, and their biological roles include cell-to-cell and immune recognition. While it is well known that the structural properties of saccharides correlate with their biological functions, it remains difficult to assign these structural details in solution by experimental methods. This difficulty has led to a heavy reliance on theoretical methods to assign structures even though these methods have been difficult to validate experimentally. This project aims to solve this problem by developing and applying a new experimental technique to determine populations of flexible domains in saccharides in solution, including the linkages connecting them together in polymers and linkages that attach them to other biomolecules. The experiment-derived information obtained can be compared to what is obtained from theory to test and/or validate the latter. Senior researchers, graduate students and undergraduates with interests and expertise in experimental and computational science collaborate to achieve the objectives of the project. This work provides valuable new tools to determine molecular structure that can be generally applied to any biomolecule in solution, including proteins and nucleic acids.<br/><br/>This research project uses stable isotopically labeled oligosaccharides and glycopeptides, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spin-couplings, density functional theory calculations, circular statistics and X-ray crystallography to determine conformational populations of the flexible domains of oligosaccharides in solution. This experimental approach is possible because saccharides contain multiple NMR spin-couplings that report on the same conformational domain, allowing quantitative treatments that yield continuous single- and multi-state populational models. Once a given domain is parameterized (e.g., O- or N-glycosidic linkage), its conformational properties can be investigated in different structural contexts to determine the degree to which it adapts conformationally to environmental cues. Experimental models are compared to those obtained from molecular dynamics simulations to validate the latter. This work leads to new experiment-based conformational classifications of O-glycosidic linkages in oligosaccharides, and to a deeper understanding of the multiple factors that influence oligosaccharide conformation in solution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Non-fouling materials can effectively resist nonspecific interactions in complex media, but are inert without any immunosuppressive properties. At the same time, immunomodulatory drugs or molecules are capable of specifically interacting and regulating biologic systems, but lack stealth properties. For many applications, these two functions are highly desirable. However, these two types of materials and drugs compromise their functions when they are used together. In this project, a drug-free stealth biomaterial capable of directly regulating the immune response will be developed and studied so that both functions will be achieved in one biomaterial. The success of this work will not only provide new insights into the fundamental design of biomaterials, but also have far-reaching implications for applications including drug and gene delivery, cancer immunotherapy and cell therapy. Support of this project will provide highly interdisciplinary research opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students, particularly under-represented students.

It is hypothesized that zwitterionic phosphoserine-mimic polymer (ZPS) will be able to achieve both stealth and immunosuppressive properties in one biomaterial since PS is negatively charged without stealth properties. The aims of this project are to examine the dual-functional properties of ZPS and investigate the mechanisms accounting for its immunomodulatory functions. Moreover, the importance and potential application of ZPS in drug delivery will be explored. The success of the proposed work will elucidate the concept about how to integrate biological properties into inert biomaterials or endow active biomaterials with stealth properties. It will not only provide new insights into the fundamental design of biomaterials, but also enriches the arsenal of immunomodulatory biomaterials for a broad range of biomedical applications.

2002393.xml,RI: Small: Stochastic Planning and Probabilistic Inference for Factored State and Action Spaces,NSF,2019-11-01,2022-05-31,177737,"Many important problems require control of multiple actuators, or agents, in parallel, to achieve a common coordinated goal in a stochastic environment. Examples of such problems include scheduling in a building with multiple elevators, managing a team for fire and rescue operations, managing the inventory of a large company, controlling a robotic soccer team, and controlling a robotic team to manage shelving and orders in a warehouse environment. These problems naturally fit into a formulation as discrete-time central-control problems where we design an algorithm that decides what action each agent takes at any time step in order to optimize the common objective. The corresponding computational problem, known as stochastic planning, is challenging due its sheer size. In particular, the number of possible states (for example, possible positions of robots, shelves and merchandise in a warehouse) and the number of possible joint actions (combinations of actions of individual robots) are huge in any problem instance of interest. State of the art approaches typically fail due to requiring too much time to properly search for a good policy or due to requiring too much memory to store intermediate values. By viewing stochastic planning through the lens of probabilistic inference, this project proposes several novel domain independent algorithmic approaches that take advantage of problem structure to calculate approximate solutions effectively under time constraints. The project funds are largely devoted to support training and research of PhD students therefore directly support human development in an important high impact area for the nation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More concretely, we propose three competing approaches to solving such problems, all taking insight from formulating the finite horizon control problem as probabilistic inference in a corresponding graphical model, also known as a dynamic Bayesian network. The first approach uses the idea of Monte Carlo search, but adds a strong symbolic component by introducing aggregate trajectories. Aggregate trajectories are obtained by simulating a compositional symbolic model under independence assumptions over the random variables. Each aggregate trajectory provides a value estimate that is approximate but can replace numerous individual trajectories. In this way we get fast approximation of values and effective control under time constraints. The second approach uses problem structure to translate the inference problem into an integer linear program, where the objective and quality of the solution can be traded-off for speed through problem  decomposition. A novel construction shows how to sidestep the exponential complexity of the problem and obtain a sequence of integer programs that are both small and decomposable so as to yield effective control under time constraints. The third approach, or more accurately framework, builds on the tight connection between stochastic planning and probabilistic inference in the corresponding dynamic Bayesian network. We show that variants of the first two approaches can be viewed in this light, and through this we propose new inference algorithms for solving the stochastic planning problem. In addition, based on this analysis, we propose  new algorithms for probabilistic inference, and new generalized inference questions that go beyond current research on marginal map in graphical models."

Often the equations that one encounters are algebraic in nature, like those describing lines, circles, parabolas and the like, in contrast with, say, equations involving the trigonometric functions, or logarithms, or derivatives. Typically, the equations have infinitely many solutions---think about the equation defining a circle---and it is usually not possible to write down a complete list of solutions. Rather, the objective is to find ways to study the structure of the collection of the solution set, which is called a variety. A fruitful approach has been to consider the (algebraic) functions on the variety. These functions form a mathematical structure called a commutative ring, and my research has been dedicated to understanding these structures; not in the abstract, but in their various manifestations, which are galore, they arise in quite diverse contexts across mathematics and physics. Mathematics has also been remarkably successful in describing and studying phenomenon related to symmetry. This leads to another mathematical structure called a group. Intriguingly, in certain contexts, there is a way to attach a commutative ring---and a variety---to a group and in the past few years various researchers, including the PI, have been able to solve problems related to groups using tools that had been developed to study varieties. A part of the current project deals with these aspects.<br/><br/>Two major themes weave through this project. One is the study of invariants of finite free complexes over commutative noetherian local rings; the second is the modular representation theory of finite groups and group schemes. The former too is connected to groups via certain conjectures in the theory of transformation groups. These conjectures---due to Adem, Avramov, Browder, Buchweitz, Carlsson, Swan, Halperin and others---postulated lower bounds on the length of the homology modules, and on the total rank, of such complexes, when the homology has nonzero finite length. Recently the PI and Mark Walker found counterexamples for many of these conjectures. One set of problems outlined in this project are aimed at discovering and establishing the ``correct"" bounds for these invariants. Another set of projects seek to probe the structure of the stable module category of representations of a finite group, or finite group scheme, over a field of positive characteristic. The focus is on ``local strata"" and various finiteness conditions for modules in this strata; in particular, on dualizability and cohomological finiteness. The multiplicative structure of Hochschild cohomology of commutative algebras is a third main topic of this proposal. The goal here is to characterize locally complete intersection algebras in terms of their Hochschild cohomology.

Within this mandate it is essential that all persons, regardless of background, are included in STEM training at the PhD level.  Among STEM disciplines, physics has shown persistent issues regarding representation of persons from diverse backgrounds. This project will assess current reforms in a US-based graduate physics and astronomy program to understand their impacts on students’ educational experiences and success. The results of this study will be used to refine the program at the University of Utah and to develop best practices that can be adopted nationwide.<br/><br/><br/>During the 2018-19 academic year, admissions into the Physics & Astronomy graduate program at the University of Utah was halted while a complete overhaul of all aspects of the program was initiated by the Department.  The program reform included the recruitment and admissions process, orientation and teaching assistant training, advising practices and other student support, the curriculum, and the exam structure. The first incoming class of graduate students has now entered the new program and are navigating these new policies and practices. The investigators will conduct a qualitative semi-ethnographic study on the experiences and outcomes of graduate students under the newly revised graduate program. This will be done by conducting multiple interviews with the new cohort of students throughout their first year in the program. Additionally, open ended survey data will be collected from the legacy students in the program to understand their experiences under the previous policies. This will offer a pseudo-control group to further understand the changes created for students by the new policies.  In addition, the results will be the basis for a longitudinal study of graduate student experiences at the University of Utah, and will be disseminated to the broader community through the literature, conference presentations, and visits to other departments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Combining AM with printing of metallic electrical circuits inside the 3D object can drastically enhance the functional capabilities of 3D parts. While many such fabrication approaches have been suggested, they impose a tradeoff between electronic performance, material capability, and material cost. This project will create new knowledge on a novel process that breaks this tradeoff. Multifunctional 3D parts are in increasing demand for aerospace, robotics, healthcare, defense, and Internet-of-Things applications. Thus, the new manufacturing capabilities enabled by this project will have multiple transformative socio-economic benefits and stimulate a new generation of product innovations in the additive manufacturing industry. This research will combine several disciplines including manufacturing, thermal, mechanics, optics, and materials science. This project will create multiple outreach testbeds for engaging women and underrepresented minorities across high school, middle school, and undergraduate levels. This team will engage industry by organizing additive manufacturing symposia, and perform public outreach via the creation of video articles. This integration of research and education will encourage diversity in engineering and manufacturing across multiple educational levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project’s goal is to enable concurrent 3D printing of polymer parts and electrically conductive metal circuits inside the part while achieving high electrical conductivity and low material cost. This research will test the hypothesis that flash light fusion of core-shell nanowires and physics-informed tuning of the process parameters can achieve those goals. Coupled optical, thermal, mass transfer and mechanical models over multiple length scales will be created and experimentally validated. This research will fill key knowledge gaps on the dynamics of optically-driven fusion in core-shell nanowires, thermomechanically-driven changes in circuit conductivity during polymer printing, and the relationship between the process parameters and performance.

2002003.xml,Doctoral Dissertation Research: Maintenance of Tradition Amid Organizational Pressures to Change,NSF,2020-05-01,2023-09-30,15997,"This dissertation project investigates how a distinct subgroup may create novel organizational practices by preserving traditional knowledge and practices in a contemporary setting.  The setting is a unique organization: a medical clinic owned by the subgroup.  To treat patients both from the subgroup and not from the subgroup in their clinic, the subgroup’s approach to treatment centers on the integration of distinct modalities including conventional, integrative, and traditional treatment.  This project examines the impact of subgroup ownership of the clinic on the creation of new forms of treatment.  It also examines how distinct treatment modalities, often considered incompatible because they involve different theories, practices, and evidence, are negotiated in a single institution.  This project reveals how practitioners collaborate across epistemological and methodological divides in their attempt to establish more efficient and effective practices.  In so doing, it contributes to the sociology of science and technology and medical sociology as it explores changing boundaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The methods for this study involve participant observation, interviews, and document analysis.  Participant observation allows answering questions concerning subgroup healing practices and combining modalities.  Approximately 40 interviews are being held with subgroup personnel involved with the establishment and operation of the clinic.  Documents analyzed include media reports, clinic promotional materials, and internal documentation of the clinic’s development.  As integrative clinics proliferate, this research will help practitioners anticipate the problems that may arise in attempting to combine disparate modalities.  Further, this project will provide insight into the challenges and opportunities in creating culturally tailored services for treatment.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2003358.xml,NSF/MCB-BSF: Characterization of the roles of mitotic associated histone deacetylation patterns,NSF,2020-08-15,2025-07-31,750000,"This international collaboration between scientists in the U.S. and Israel investigates a key question about mitosis, the process of cell division in animal, plant, and other eukaryotic cells.  During mitosis, chromosomes duplicate and have to be physically separated into two new offspring cells during division.  In order to physically separate the duplicated chromosomes, the structure of the chromosomes must become condensed, which interferes with using the DNA in the chromosomes as a template to transcribe messenger RNA.  Cell division thereby causes a temporary pause in most gene expression.  A cell’s activities are highly dependent on gene expression; for example a lung cell and a skin cell have distinct physiological roles largely due to differences in gene expression. A major unanswered question is the genetic mechanism by which the two offspring cells restore gene expression, and thus all other activities, following mitosis. The research approach for answering this question involves a combination of laboratory experiments and computational analysis.  The project will teach the public about the power of interdisciplinary research through producing professional videos in collaboration with the University of California, San Diego-TV.  To broaden the participation of all groups in science, the US-based lab will also partner with UCSD’s STARS (Summer Training Academy for Research Success) program.  <br/><br/>Mitosis, a tightly regulated cell cycle phase, is critical for ensuring that cellular identity is correctly relayed to offspring cells. It involves key changes including a decrease in transcription. Initial studies showed that mitosis includes global deacetylation of histones, and that there is a mitosis-specific deacetylation of the nucleosome entering the nucleosome-depleted region of most transcribed genes. Otherwise, little is known about the roles that mitotic-specific patterns of histone marks play in regulating the transcriptional changes during and following mitosis. This project focuses on the involvement of mitotic histone deacetylations.  In particular, this work focuses on three candidate histone deacetylase enzymes that are already implicated in mitosis.  Pharmaceuticals will be used to inhibit selectively each of the candidate enzymes and the PIs will use genome-scale strategies to measure changes in the location and amounts of histone acetylation during the cell cycle.  The PIs will also examine the extent to which the three candidates enzymes individually affect gene expression during and immediately following mitosis.  Lastly, the project will establish a system to locally modify the acetylation of target loci at a specific time during the cell cycle.  Such a technique would allow future studies of detailed locus-specific mitotic gene expression and reactivation kinetics. Together, the integrative approaches will enable this collaborative project to address key questions regarding the cellular means required for the proper execution of mitosis and re-establishing cellular identity after division.<br/><br/>This collaborative US/Israel project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the Israeli Binational Science Foundation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001043.xml,CSEDI: Collaborative Research: Experimental Partitioning of Highly Siderophile Elements at Ultratrace Level for Understanding the Conditions of Core Formation,NSF,2020-05-01,2025-04-30,136725,"Gold, platinum, osmium, irridium, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, and rhenium (known collectively as highly siderophile elements) are among the rarest elements available to mankind. Their widespread use in technology and the arts results in a high cost. It also justifies extensive mining, which has a high environmental and human health impact. The reason for their scarcity is that they were scavenged into the core when Earth separated into a silicate outer layer (mantle and crust) and a metallic core. Even if these elements are highly depleted in the mantle, previous experimental work indicates that they are overabundant relative to expectation for scavenging by the core. Available experiments suggest that the mantle should be completely barren of these elements, which is not what is seen. A likely explanation for this discrepancy between experiments and observations is that the highly siderophile elements were delivered into the Earth's mantle by the late impact addition of meteoritic material after the core had formed. There are differences however between the composition of the mantle and meteorites, notably for ruthenium, and an important question is whether previous experiments reliably predict the scavenging of highly siderophile elements in the core. These experiments were limited in the pressure-temperature conditions that they could achieve and relies on large extrapolations to make inferences about the scavenging efficiency of the core. A new experimental approach relying on the laser ionization of selected highly siderophile elements coupled with experiments done in diamond anvil cells that can routinely reach pressures of 700,000 atmospheres and temperatures of 4500 K, will allow the partitioning of highly siderophile elements to be measured under core formation conditions without relying on large extrapolations. This work will apply a relatively new technique (Resonant Ionization Mass Spectrometry - RIMS) to in situ ultratrace analyses, which can find applications in a variety of fields outside of Earth sciences, including material sciences/development and nuclear forensics.  The project is a multidisciplinary collaboration between geochemists, physicists and instrument developers, an experimental petrologist, and a high-pressure mineral physicist. The project will support two graduate as well as undergraduate students, who will be trained on a multidisciplinary research project. The PIs will also be involved in outreach at the K-12 level through the French-American Science Festival.<br/><br/>The reason for the depletions in highly siderophile elements (HSEs) in the mantle is their removal into Earth’s core, and their subsequent replenishment by late accretion of extraterrestrial material representing ~0.5 % of Earth’s mass. To first order, this model of late delivery of chondritic material to the Earth can account for the abundance of HSEs in the mantle but it fails to explain the elevated Ru/Pt and Pd/Pt ratios in the mantle relative to chondrites and other HSEs. One explanation for these high ratios is that Ru and Pd may be less siderophile or chalcophile compared to other HSEs, resulting in their partial retention in mantle when the core formed. Testing this hypothesis is however difficult because the relevant metal/silicate partitioning experiments have been done at P-T conditions that are quite remote from those that are thought to have prevailed during core formation. The investigators will study the origin of HSEs in Earth’s mantle by applying a novel ultra-trace element quantification technique known as RIMS to measure the concentrations of selected HSEs in metal-silicate experiments done using piston cylinders and diamond anvil cells (DACs). Through this collaboration between geochemists, physicists and instrument developers, an experimental petrologist, and a high-pressure mineral physicist, the research group will study the effect of nano/micro metal nuggets on metal/silicate partition data, and will measure the partition coefficients of Ru, Pd, and Pt at 0–70 GPa and 2100–4500 K, which spans conditions relevant to core formation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Level 1 STEM learning and learning environments project aims to broaden understanding of who is affected by modeling-based instruction in undergraduate life sciences, and how they are affected. Modeling is vital to STEM professions and national standards call for modeling instruction at all levels of STEM education. Despite behavioral work indicating that modeling-based instruction enhances STEM learning, there is a critical gap in understanding what mechanisms make it effective and which students benefit most from this instructional approach. The proposed project draws on the body of knowledge about STEM expertise from cognitive science. Specifically, as disciplinary experts interact with or create models of biological systems, they continuously engage in error checking to evaluate a model’s credibility and simultaneously inhibit information that is irrelevant to the task.  Specific regions of the experts' brains become activated as they evaluate models.  These regions include the lateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate regions, which are linked to error detection and inhibition. These observations suggest that error checking and inhibition are integral brain functions for development of STEM expertise.  However, it is not known whether undergraduate STEM students, who are not yet disciplinary experts, use similar processes and associated neural systems during modeling-based instruction. It is also not yet known whether error checking and inhibition influence students’ long-term retention of disciplinary and modeling knowledge. A deeper understanding about how modeling-based instruction benefits students and for whom it is most effective may be used to develop more effective STEM instruction to meet the needs of all students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this project are to (a) describe the nature and extent to which undergraduate life sciences students engage in error detection and inhibition during model evaluation, and (b) determine how these processes are associated with long-term knowledge retention. Interviews with students will enable characterization of the types and extent of error detection.  Brain scans using fMRI will determine the functional neural responses. Comparative interviews and neurological scans after one year of instruction will determine how variation in ability to detect errors predicts long-term retention of conceptual and model-based knowledge. Results from this research will be disseminated at research conferences and through peer-reviewed literature. The research will inform development of a modeling-based instruction case study on learning for undergraduate life science students. The proposed project is a joint effort between the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Michigan State University and is supported by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001507.xml,Digitization TCN: Collaborative Research: Mobilizing Millions of Marine Mollusks of the Eastern Seaboard,NSF,2020-09-15,2024-08-31,76399,"The Eastern Seaboard of the United States (ESB, U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone) stretches from the Canadian border on the Atlantic along nearly 6,000 km of eastern coastline, around the Floridian Peninsula, and along the Gulf of Mexico to the south end of the Texan coast, including 18 U.S. states. The ESB region is densely populated, with 47% of the U.S. population expected to inhabit the counties adjacent to the shoreline by 2021. Habitat loss, pollution, overfishing, and climate change threaten commercially and ecologically important marine species all along the ESB. This project will make occurrence data with map coordinates available for over 3,000 species of mollusks that find their habitat along the ESB, including mussels, clams, conchs, snails, and squid. Data from these ecologically and commercially important species (over 4.5 million individual specimens) will be made available through public online data portals. While the geographic ranges for many species of mollusks are well-known, the extent of their distribution within the seafloor habitats they occupy is unknown. Adding map coordinates to occurrence records for live-collected mollusks in natural history collections will provide detailed knowledge of distributions. Because natural history collections have specimens collected from the mid-1800s to present, these occurrence records can help track distributional changes over time and lead to better fisheries and conservation management.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One hundred million mollusk specimens have been documented in natural history collections across North America, and the breadth, depth, and growth of these collections is exceptionally well-known compared to other invertebrate taxa. Mollusks are among the best sampled group of animals, with some species having over 2,000 digital records available in natural history collections making them extremely well-suited for environmental and biogeographical studies that track faunal change over time and space. However, already-digitized mollusk lots are missing essential data such as collecting date (30% of records) and reliable georeferences (85% of records). This project will generate reliable geo-coordinate data for all covered specimen lots using a collaborative georeferencing project in GeoLocate.  GeoLocate will add layers for bathymetric data, benthic habitat, and marine conservation areas. Incorporating bathymetry into GeoLocate to determine the extent of locations will also provide that capability for complex elevational data for terrestrial species. Important trait data will also be incorporated. For the first time, molluscan occurrence data will distinguish between live- and dead-collected specimens, with a defined vocabulary for traits added to each record. Due to the long persistence of molluscan shells, the live/dead- collected distinction is crucial for all studies of biotic change using mollusks. Information on collecting dates will be refined where possible to increase resolution for detecting biotic changes. The data will be shared through public data repositories, including iDigBio, GBIF, OBIS, and the InvertEBase Symbiota portal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nevertheless, it still offers many difficult unsolved questions. The core part of this project is to tackle these questions with cutting-edge modern methods coming from the homological mirror symmetry program. Homological mirror symmetry is a deep geometric duality that originates in quantum field theory and has been used in studying novel phenomena and proving unexpected results in symplectic geometry suggested by algebraic geometry. This project aims to use homological mirror symmetry to introduce new applications of symplectic topology to algebraic geometry and to answer classical open questions in birational geometry. A postdoctoral fellow will be involved in various aspects of this research project.<br/><br/>This project will use an approach based on categorical Kähler geometry. The most notable application of this approach is toward proving the non-rationality of generic, four-dimensional cubics, which is arguably the central problem in algebraic geometry. More specifically, a detailed study of the singularities of quantum D-modules produces a completely new type of birational invariant. This new invariant is a canonical decomposition of the cohomology of a four-dimensional cubic based on simultaneous use of both (algebraic and symplectic) sides of homological mirror symmetry. The example of four-dimensional cubics is only the tip of the iceberg.

Natural Mn oxides typically contain a range of impurities, but the impact of these impurities on the chemical reactions and mineral transformations are unknown. Mn oxides have important applications in industry, such as in batteries, energy storage devices, and sensors. There are potential industrial uses of minerals whose properties could be changed by including metal impurities.

Hausmannite and manganite substituted with varying trace metal types (divalent-only Ni and Zn versus redox-active Co) and concentrations (1 and 2 wt%) are measured for As(III) oxidizing ability and transition metal solubility to quantify the substitution effects. The mineralogical transformation kinetics in substituted minerals are also compared with pristine minerals. A variety of state-of-the-art analytical techniques are employed to characterize the coordination chemistry and valence of metal substituents, probe interfacial redox chemistry, and identify transformation products.

Power distribution grid resiliency is a challenging problem with significant economic and security impacts that has been exacerbated in recent years by the increase in extreme weather events and cyber threats. Recently, networked microgrids have become an emerging paradigm that demonstrates resiliency benefit to their local customers. However, lack of awareness of stability margin, inadequate capability to respond to grid disturbances, and vulnerabilities to communication failure, delay, and cyber-attacks can undermine the capability of networked microgrids to improve distribution grid resiliency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project will create and implement networked microgrids solutions on a novel cyber infrastructure to ensure distribution grid resiliency. This cyber infrastructure is based on Software-Defined Networking. Specifically, the project has three main objectives: (1) To establish a formal analysis method to tractably assess networked microgrid stability; (2) To devise a new concept of microgrid active fault management (AFM) enabled through online distributed optimization; and (3) To build a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) based architecture to enable highly resilient networked microgrids. The project will contribute new formal analysis theories for deeper understanding of microgrid stability under high levels of renewable generation. The idea of integrating distributed optimization and power electronic control will pave the way for building grid-friendly networked microgrids, significantly contributing to grid resiliency. The novel SDN-based architecture and techniques will open the door for innovations in devising secure, reliable, and fault-tolerant algorithms for managing resilient networked microgrids and active distribution networks. Overall, the proposed new model-based and data-intensive technologies together will provide scalable, dependable and intelligent solutions to otherwise intractable problems in integrating complex networked microgrids.

2001980.xml,Exotic Quantum Liquid Phases Due to Intrinsic Degrees of Anisotropy,NSF,2021-01-01,2024-12-31,240000,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The Division of Materials Research and the Division of Human Resource Development contribute funds to this award. It supports fundamental theoretical and computational research and education involving the study of electrons confined to two dimensions and subject to interactions and crystal environments that lead to a preferred direction.<br/><br/>Atoms and molecules are made of elementary particles such as electrons, protons, and neutrons. Electrons are often tightly bound to their atoms. Materials are made of many billions of atoms, and in metals and semiconductor materials some electrons can move relatively freely. These electrons can behave like a liquid and can easily respond to externally applied fields, such as electric fields, magnetic fields, and applied pressure. For example, a copper wire conducts electricity in response to an applied electric field.<br/><br/>Since many interesting properties of materials are determined by the behavior of such free electrons, it is natural to study the nature of the possible states of electronic matter that arise in large systems of electrons and the dependence of their properties on external parameters, such as temperature, electron density, and applied magnetic field. The PI will study electronic states in materials where free electrons are restricted to two-dimensions where the interaction between electrons and quantum effects may combine leading to new phenomena and new electronic states of matter. The electrons may be in a uniform liquid state of matter if interactions are not very strong. The properties of such a liquid state would be isotropic - the same in all directions. However, it is possible that effective interactions between electrons are anisotropic or direction dependent. The presence of the crystalline lattice of atoms makes electrons behave as though they have an effective mass that can depend on the direction of their motion. This may lead to electrons behaving like a liquid of elongated rods leading to electronic states analogous to those assumed by the rod-like molecules in a liquid crystal display. The PI will investigate electronic states that may arise as a consequence of anisotropy. This includes externally induced anisotropy, such as the anisotropic states that could arise under the application of a strong magnetic field perpendicular to the 2D world of the electrons. The investigation of new electronic states adds to the intellectual foundations that lead to new electronic device technologies. <br/><br/>The research activities conducted in this project will lead to research opportunities for economically challenged students in the setting of a HBCU, will enhance research and education in an undergraduate environment, and will improve the preparation of undergraduate students for graduate studies. Overall, this project will help to enhance the research and the education infrastructure at the local institution, and lead to broader participation of underrepresented groups in science.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The Division of Materials Research and the Division of Human Resource Development contribute funds to this award. It supports fundamental theoretical and computational research to investigate the emergence of novel anisotropic exotic quantum liquid phases in strongly correlated Fermi systems. The PI will study two-dimensional systems of electrons in the quantum Hall regime and two-dimensional Fermi liquid phases with deformed Fermi surfaces in presence of some internal degree of anisotropy. The PI aims to understand how anisotropic electronic ordered states arise in various quantum phases in response to intrinsic anisotropy of the system. The PI will also investigate the nature of novel exotic anisotropic phases such as anisotropic quantum Hall liquid phases driven by an anisotropic interaction potential and anisotropic Fermi liquid phases with deformed Fermi surfaces driven by a combination of anisotropic effective mass and an anisotropic interaction potential between electrons.<br/><br/>The theoretical approaches can be applied to experiments on two-dimensional electron systems with strong mass anisotropy where unusual anisotropic transport in the quantum Hall regime is anticipated. The ideas of this research can be relevant to understand experiments in two-dimensional systems of electrons confined in aluminum arsenide quantum wells and related systems. The electron effective mass anisotropy ratios can be almost one order of magnitude in these systems. Of particular interest is how tuning piezoelectric properties effects the anisotropic effective electron interactions, and the resulting experimentally observable consequences.  Experiments may be proposed to detect signatures in transport properties resulting from the interplay of different sources of anisotropy. The PI will consider other physical systems as well, including ultracold atoms in anisotropic lattice traps. <br/><br/>The PI and his team will use a combination of theoretical and computational methods, including exact diagonalization and quantum Monte Carlo, to carry out the research. Students will use methods suited to their skills, such as variational or perturbation methods from quantum theory, or computer simulations, in order to enhance their educational experience as appropriate. The research provides a setting for education and mentoring to enhance interest in science and leading careers in STEM. This project will help broaden participation of minority and economically challenged students in science and engineering through enhancing the pipeline.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2002448.xml,Collaborative Research: Quantifying the sea-surface temperature pattern effect for Last Glacial Maximum and Pliocene constraints on climate sensitivity,NSF,2020-06-01,2025-05-31,87880,"Predictions of future climate change are based in part on changes seen in geological records of times with different climates. Such times include the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) 21 thousand years ago (a colder time with lower atmospheric carbon dioxide levels) and the Pliocene Epoch 5.3 to 2.6 million years ago (a warmer time with higher carbon dioxide). These periods can be used to estimate the sensitivity of climate to changes in greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. Those sensitivity estimates help predict the amount of global warming we should expect to see in response to future greenhouse gas emissions. However, recent work has shown that the climate’s sensitivity to greenhouse gases depends not only on the average surface temperature change but also on the geographic pattern of that change. Thus, use of geological paleoclimate records to estimate future warming must account for how the spatial pattern of temperature changes in the past differs from that expected in the future. This project will combine information from paleoclimate data and climate models to evaluate the spatial pattern of surface temperature changes during the LGM and Pliocene. It will then develop methods to account for temperature pattern differences when using data from these past periods to help estimate future global warming.<br/><br/>Earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is the change in average surface temperature associated with a doubling of the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (CO2) relative to the pre-industrial atmosphere. The ECS is set by the radiative feedbacks that link surface warming to changes in the amount of radiation leaving Earth’s atmosphere. Recent studies have shown that global radiative feedbacks depend on the spatial pattern of sea-surface temperature (SST). Estimates of ECS based on the proxy record of past climate changes – such as those during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and Pliocene –  have traditionally been based on global mean energy budget constraints and thus do not account for how SST patterns in those states may be different from those in the future. This research will use recently developed data assimilation techniques, combining information from climate models and proxies, to reconstruct gridded SST fields for the LGM and Pliocene that are dynamically consistent with available proxy data. These SST fields will then be compared against those projected by global climate models under CO2 forcing. The sensitivity of radiative feedbacks to differences between LGM / Pliocene and CO2-forced SST patterns will then be quantified using a suite of atmospheric general circulation models and Green’s functions that link warming patterns to radiative feedbacks. By producing estimates of LGM and Pliocene surface temperature patterns and quantifying the impact of temperature pattern differences on radiative feedbacks, this research will improve our understanding of ECS derived from those past climate states. This work will further facilitate researchers’ participation in activities aimed at introducing high school students to climate science, through Current Climate Science workshops for high school teachers facilitated by the University of Washington’s Program on Climate Change and through George Mason University’s Aspiring Scientists Summer Internship Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2003196.xml,AXS - Enabling Analysis of Petascale Astronomical Datasets,NSF,2020-08-01,2024-07-31,579295,"Astronomy is being rapidly transformed by the advent of large, automated, digital sky surveys into a field where petabyte tabular data sets are becoming commonplace. Unfortunately, this increase has not been followed by commensurate improvements in the tools and frameworks: we are now limited not by the richness of our datasets, but by an inability to mine them for knowledge.  When the most challenging questions of the day demand repeated, complex processing of large information-rich tabular datasets, scalable and stable tools that are easy to use by scientists are crucial. This is a project to develop, package, and deploy the Astronomical eXtensions for Spark (AXS), a scalable open-source astronomical data analysis framework built on Apache Spark.  AXS will make it possible for astronomers, including and perhaps especially those who are not data management experts, to devise and execute astronomical big data analyses using industry-standard tools.  This will be a transformative increase in the community's ability to extract knowledge from datasets collected at great expense, thus unlocking their value across all areas of astronomy.  There will be opportunities for knowledge transfers and partnerships between industry and academia.  The techniques used and created will be taught within the astronomy curriculum, and those curriculum materials will be made public. This will improve the competitiveness of astronomy students in careers beyond astronomy, and it will help to develop a globally competitive STEM workforce.<br/><br/>AXS will enable astronomers to scale their analysis from a personal laptop to thousands of nodes on either cloud or NSF-supported cyberinfrastructure (CI).  This system has already been prototyped, and leverages Spark, a state-of-the-art industry-standard engine for big data processing, to make it possible to query and analyze almost arbitrarily large astronomical catalogs while supporting complex workflows with astronomy-specific operations.  The tool will be accompanied by a hosted demonstration service, documentation, and support for deployment on NSF CI resources and public cloud platforms.  For long-term sustainability, AXS will be developed in a tight loop with major stakeholders, built on open source tools and processes, and strongly integrated with AstroPy and the PyData stack, which are widely used in astronomy.  AXS will also robustly scale to large computational clusters, making both NSF-supported and public CI more accessible to astronomers. Developments by this project will enable other industrial and academic applications, especially those dealing with large, tabular, spatio-temporal datasets indexed on a sphere, such as geospatial analysis.<br/><br/>This award by the Division of Astronomical Sciences within the NSF Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences is jointly supported by the NSF Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Operator algebras arose as a mathematical framework for quantum mechanics, and the field today is a highly active research area. The Groundwork for Operator Algebras Lecture Series (GOALS) is a two-week summer school and workshop that aims to provide early-career graduate students with an introduction to the fundamental techniques and current research in operator algebras. In addition, GOALS aims to increase, in this field, the participation and retention of persons from traditionally underrepresented groups by removing technical barriers to the field and building a strong community of support among the participants, contributors, and organizers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of operator algebras is a branch of functional analysis, which has a long-standing dialogue with various fields of mathematics and physics, such as topology, group theory, conformal field theory, probability, and logic, to name a few. The breadth of knowledge required to actively engage in operator algebras can be intimidating; there is a need to provide future researchers with an introduction to fundamental techniques and current research. The objectives of GOALS will be accomplished via lecture series on the basics of C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras; problem sessions; evening discussions on psychological barriers; expository talks about more advanced topics; and a culminating conference with leading researchers in operator algebras.

Accomplishing these multitude of functions requires the bats to control, adapt, and coordinate their wing motions, body posture, and internal actions that they engage in while airborne. This project seeks to understand how bats master the integration of kinematics, aerodynamics, and control in such complex aerial behaviors.  This would shed light on underlying fluid dynamics and kinematic controls in biology, and also impact  the ability for engineers to replicate such abilities in technical systems in the next-generation multiple-functioning drones with flapping flight. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to understand aerial multi-tasking by bats based on comprehensive experiments and mathematical models. The project will obtain experimental data from two different approaches: The morphing wing kinematics of the bats during demanding flight maneuvers and behavioral multi-tasking situations will be recorded with an array of synchronized high-speed cameras and processed with deep learning methods. These biological data will be complemented by experiments with a biomimetic robotic system that will be implemented to mimic the bats' morphing wings and will be used to explore a larger parameter spaces than would be possible with observations of the animals. This will provide insights into the effects of different kinematic patterns. In parallel, mathematical models of flapping flight will be developed to extract the key physics in the sophisticated maneuvers seen the in the experiments. The simulation of flapping flight will further elucidate the trade-off between the energetics and stability of flight. Throughout the project, we will actively disseminate our findings to educate K-12 students and the general public.

These storms have huge impacts on both coastal ecosystems and the people that use and enjoy those natural resources.  However, the impacts of each storm are unique in both the amount of damage and recovery time.  Furthermore, the frequency, intensity, and locations where tropical cyclones occur are expected to change.  Tropical cyclones may become more common in some regions or more intense in others.  This award will increase the understanding of what storm characteristics and the aspects of the affected coastal ecosystems result in the differential impacts among storms and rates of recovery.  In the Research Coordination Network for Hurricane Ecosystem Response Synthesis (RCN-HERS) scientists from diverse disciplines and areas of expertise will contribute their collective knowledge and the wealth of existing data on storm impacts on coastal ecosystems to answer these questions.  The data assembled through RCN-HERS will be publicly available for other research teams to use for future work and the project will build a collaborative network of researchers across disciplines of ecology, sociology, economics, and natural resource management. The understanding gained from this project will help researchers predict the impacts of future storms and provide recommendations for managing coastal ecosystems for greater resilience.  The RCN-HERS website will serve as a publicly accessible data warehouse and venue for sharing information about research activities, findings, and products. Findings from the project will also be disseminated to the public through local outreach presentations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Research Coordination Network for Hurricane Ecosystem Response Synthesis will have the overarching goal of linking terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecologists with economists, sociologists, statisticians, modelers, and resource managers to develop a synthetic understanding of the factors governing the resistance and resilience of coastal ecosystems to tropical cyclones, as well as a coordinated approach to comparing among events and their impacts.  Participants will meet through a series of workshops and webinars to bring together existing data on ecosystem responses to hurricanes. Researchers will also work together to develop and implement a series of thematic approaches to analyzing and comprehensively synthesizing this existing data and information to build recommendations for future networked research to continue to advance ecological understanding of how hurricanes will impact coastal ecosystems in the future.  Project activities will be centered around three workshops to address topics focused on understanding 1) interactions among antecedent conditions and storm characteristics on ecosystem responses, 2) roles of eco-evolutionary history, life history, and biodiversity on ecosystem responses, and 3) feedbacks among natural and social-economic systems that confer resistance and resilience to tropical cyclones.

2000984.xml,Nonlinear Dynamics of Pneumatic Isolators in Ultra-Precision Manufacturing Machines,NSF,2020-06-01,2024-05-31,325524,"Ultra-precision manufacturing (UPM) machines enable the production of micro- and nano-devices that are critical for the advances in the electronics, biomedical, communications and other cutting-edge industries. As a critical step in meeting UPM machine’s stringent precision requirement, they must be isolated from unwanted vibrations stemming from fast moving machines and ground motions. For this purpose, pneumatic (passive) isolators are often preferred over active systems because of their relatively low cost and energy efficiency. Recent studies have demonstrated that the performance of pneumatic isolators can be significantly improved using more sophisticated control approaches. However, those past studies did not account for the well-known inherent complex, and nonlinear, behaviors in pneumatic isolators. The aim of this award is to support fundamental research to understand the nonlinear dynamics of passively-isolated UPM machines and determine how the benefits of nonlinear dynamics can be exploited to improve the performance of pneumatic isolators. The knowledge gained will enable U.S. manufacturing industry to build cheaper, better, and faster UPM machines, advancing national prosperity and impacting efforts to secure the national defense. In a broader context, the findings can also be applied to a broader class of nonlinear mechanical and electromechanical systems. The research work will also help broaden the representation and retention of underrepresented minority (URM) in engineering fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project will be the first to conduct a nonlinear vibration analysis of pneumatic isolators to scientifically reveal whether the benefits of mode coupling observed in linear systems can be extended to nonlinear systems. To this end, a nonlinear system identification via a direct reconciliation of experimental measurements and theoretical modeling will be conducted to detect and quantify the nonlinear stiffness and nonlinear damping of pneumatic isolators. A thorough theoretical analysis will then be carried out to understand the interplay between nonlinear mode coupling, stability, and bifurcation in pneumatic isolated UPM machines. Optimal control theory will be used to determine the optimum design parameters, which will then serve as guidelines for improving the design of pneumatic isolators. Rigorous physical experimentation will be performed to guide and validate the theoretical findings. The outcome of the researched work will lead to new insights on how to exploit nonlinear dynamic phenomena for improving the performance of pneumatic isolators. The PI will continue to focus on the participation from underrepresented groups though connections to the National Society of Black Engineers and other STEM-related activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2001239.xml,EAGER: Collaborative Research: Bayesian Reasoning Machine on a Magneto-tunneling Junction Network,NSF,2020-08-01,2022-07-31,149986,"Bayesian networks are a computational model that is very efficient for computing in the presence of uncertainty. It excels in such tasks as predicting stock market behavior, disease progression, etc. It is ideal for taking an event that occurred and predicting the likelihood of different known causes to have been the contributing factor. For example, given the symptoms of a patient, it can compute the probabilities of various diseases that could be causing the symptoms. Unfortunately, implementing Bayesian networks usually requires complex hardware that is expensive, prone to failure, dissipates too much energy and consumes too much area on a computer chip. The goal of this research is to overcome these disadvantages by replacing traditional electronic hardware with magnetic devices that interact with each other in a special way to elicit Bayesian inference. This can reduce the hardware complexity and all associated costs dramatically, making Bayesian networks compact and efficient. This research will establish the viability of this approach through extensive simulations. Graduate students will be trained in this field to produce a pool of skilled scientists and engineers with cutting-edge knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bayesian networks for computing in the presence of uncertainty leverage Bayesian inference engines implemented with complex hardware that often involves microcontrollers, shift registers, analog-to-digital converters, logic gates, etc. that dissipate exorbitant amounts of energy and have enormous footprints on a chip. It ha recently been shown by the project team that magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) that interact with each other by means of dipole coupling can implement Bayesian networks with vastly reduced energy cost and much smaller footprints.  Two dipole coupled MTJs A and B can realize an extremely efficient 2-node Bayesian network, where the probabilities of high and low resistance states of MTJ A are set by current or voltage, while the (random) resistance state of MTJ B is determined by varying degrees of dipole coupling between the two MTJs. The degree of dipole coupling is tuned with local strain applied to the soft layer of MTJ B using electrical excitation. This allows one to generate any desired anti-correlation or correlation between the resistance states of the two MTJs that can be varied between 0% and 100% using electrical excitation. In turn, this allows the generation of programmable conditional probabilities that can be exploited for Bayesian networks. This research will build a simulation base for this approach, test the viability of MTJ-based inference engines under different scenarios and design optimal sub-systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The concept of a groupoid allows for more general symmetries, acting on a collection of objects rather than just a single one. The concept of a Lie groupoid, as well as its infinitesimal counterpart, the notion of a Lie algebroid, have played an increasing important role in various branches of mathematics, as well as its applications. For example, one can now find them in the formulation of dynamics in field theory in High Energy Physics, in various models for populations dynamics in Biology, or in evolutionary dynamics in Game Theory. Over the last two decades, the theory of Lie groupoids and Lie algebroids has undergone several exciting developments and this project aims to develop further both foundational aspects and significant new applications of the theory.

The first task continues the PI study of Poisson manifolds of compact type, which are central objects in Poisson Geometry, playing a role analogous to compact Lie algebras in Lie Theory. The second task is dedicated to multiplicity free fibrations, a.k.a. non-commutative integrable systems, and initiates the study of its generic singularities. The third task concerns the study of strict (non-formal) deformation quantization and aims to establish the first known obstructions to the existence of strict deformation quantizations of a Poisson manifold. The fourth task concerns Cartan’s realization problem underlying many classification problems in geometry, namely the ones that can be formulated in terms of (finite dimensional) families of G-structures. It aims to establish a theory of such realization problems, based on Lie groupoids and Lie algebroids, as well as to give a complete solution to the classification problem. All these tasks rely heavily on Lie groupoid techniques, many of which have yet to be developed.

Perhaps counterintuitively, it is exactly this uncertainty principle that allows us to digitize analog signals; that is, to completely recover analog (continuous) signals that are band-limited, in some sense, from their samples recorded at (appropriate) discrete set of times. The precise rate at which the sampling needs to be done to guarantee stable recovery depends crucially on the band-limited nature of the signal. The main goal of this project is to quantify this subtle relationship precisely for very general types of restriction on signal bandwidth. In addition the project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/> <br/>This project aims to develop a general operator-theoretic treatment of uncertainty principles, with a goal of unifying many different forms of the uncertainty principle that appear in harmonic analysis, and to discover new ones. In view of the advanced development of harmonic analysis, it is quite surprising that manifestations of the uncertainty principle are still usually studied one at a time, isolated one from another.

The broadest evolutionary scope of those collections is in the marine invertebrates, animals without backbones - sea stars, corals, worms, jellyfish, crabs, and thousands of other animals. That library of preserved marine invertebrates is our essential guide to the diversity of ocean life across the globe. And because they encapsulate data from the moment they were picked up, these institutional collections also act as a time machine, letting us use the past to understand how our present will become the future. But there is a problem - vast numbers of these specimens are essentially invisible outside of a tiny community of museum specialists. The only record of these specimens' existence is on labels enclosed in the jars with the preserved animals or in paper logbooks on a shelf. These specimens will remain nearly undiscoverable on museum shelves until their core descriptive information is made digitally available. Therefore, this project will create public digital records for over 7.5 million specimens from our nation's legacy of marine exploration, thereby making the immense investment in the specimens' acquisition available to 21st Century biodiversity and ecosystems research. Because these specimens provide a visible and tangible window into our oceans' enchanting biodiversity, this project will involve STEM educators and student educators in the digitization effort, so that they will be able to reflect their science experiences directly back to the classroom. The public will be involved virtually, by contributing transcription of specimen label data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digitization of alcohol-preserved marine specimens has never been carried out on this scale. A major challenge lies in the location of the data: written, typed, or printed on labels in the jars with the specimens. In many cases, that will require opening the jar, extracting the label, and either transcribing it directly or photographing it for later transcription - for hundreds of thousands of jars. The immediate participants in this program will digitize most or all of the marine invertebrate collections at nineteen institutions across the country, more than doubling the number of digital records for marine invertebrates in the U.S. All data will be publicly available through existing data portals, including iDigBio.org, using standardized data formats, thereby dramatically enhancing the accessibility of biodiversity data for comprehensive, systems-based analysis of ocean ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000097.xml,RAPID: Collaborative Research: Tracking Amazon Forest Fires from Source to Sink,NSF,2019-11-01,2022-10-31,77033,"Fire plays a key role in Earth's ecosystem dynamics with profound effects on biogeochemical processes, climate, and environmental quality beyond the significant threat to people and infrastructures. This year has seen the most forest fires in the Amazon Basin of Brazil since 2010, providing a compelling opportunity to study the impact of fires on carbon fluxes in the Amazon River system, and, together with an auspiciously-timed cruise planned to the Guyanas mudbanks in 2020, to characterize the corresponding signature of biomass burning along the entire continuum from source on land to sink in the oceans. This project takes advantage of this opportunity through time series sampling of the dissolved and particulate load in the headwaters and the lower reaches of the Amazon River. This effort will be combined with targeted sampling campaigns across the full river depth profile at high and low discharge to capture the export of material to the Atlantic Ocean. Pyrogenic carbon concentration and composition will be measured by combining specific molecular work (anhydrous sugar levoglucosan and benzene polycarboxylic acids, or BPCAs) with ramped pyrolysis oxidation to characterize the chemical continuum that makes up pyrogenic carbon. Radiocarbon content and stable carbon isotope composition will help to distinguish pyrogenic carbon derived from combustion of living biomass (as opposed to that eroded from soils or old sediments, for example). Compared to a baseline established during a period of time when fire activity in the Amazon basin was relatively low, river samples from 2019 offer a chance to test whether pyrogenic carbon fluxes to the ocean respond to an increase in fire activity. The offshore samples will allow for characterizing how this pyrogenic carbon is transformed and/or preserved in the coastal ocean. Rapid-response funding will be essential to capitalizing on the unique combination of existing baseline data, the pronounced increase in fire activity this year, and the planned 2020 cruise. The outcome of this project will lay the groundwork for future efforts at reconstructing past fire activity, e.g., in association with upcoming drilling projects in the Amazon system supported by International Continental Scientific Drilling Program and the International Ocean Drilling Program. Finally, the project will interface with the Woods Hole Partnership Educational Program, which is designed to provide college students from underrepresented minorities opportunities to gain practical experience in marine and environmental sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In mathematics such a regularity is described by the notion of groups or algebras. This research project seeks to study a certain deformation symmetry known as i-quantum groups, which exhibit a crystal-like discrete structure, not unlike what one sees in a snowflake. The PI plans to uncover higher symmetries (in categorical or geometric approaches) behind the i-quantum groups. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The i-quantum groups arising from quantum symmetric pairs are a vast generalization of quantum groups. The PI proposes a Hall algebra construction of i-quantum groups in greater generality, and constructs braid group symmetries of i-quantum groups along the way. The PI also proposes to provide a Drinfeld type construction of i-quantum groups of affine type, which will pave the way to their finite-dimensional representations and a geometric realization via classical flag varieties and more generally quiver varieties. In addition, a theory of cells for i-quantum groups will be developed. Finally, a Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier type categorification of i-quantum groups is proposed, and it will have applications to modular representations of algebraic groups and quantum groups at roots of unity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite nearly a century of research on the mechanics of thin structures, questions remain about simple reduced models commonly employed to describe bending and stretching of these bodies in response to pressure or other applied forces.  Superficially similar shell models make qualitatively different predictions, such as whether a bent shell will expand or contract under the same conditions.  Existing strip models fail to capture experimentally observed shape changes during manipulations. This work will both explain these issues and develop new simple models that will agree with experiments and be useful in a variety of settings, including the design of new flexible and reconfigurable devices, and origami and kirigami structures for engineering applications.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained as part of this project.  The PI and students will develop related laboratory demonstrations and a module for a summer science program for young women in high school.  Public outreach efforts will exploit the connections between thin structure mechanics and the behavior of toys such as snap bracelets.<br/> <br/>This work has two parts.  First, an elastic theory will be developed based on systematic expansions in stretch.  When applied to shells, this theory will preserve simple relationships between stress and generalized strain and provide the simplest definitions of bending energies.  Second, a uniformly valid theory of elastic curves will be developed that interpolates between rod and inextensible wide strip models.  This theory will capture bifurcation phenomena of narrow strips and allow numerical integration of strip deformations that create inflection points.  More broadly, the work will relate direct and dimensional reduction approaches to thin structures.  The new shell theory will be compared with theoretical and numerical results on soft shells from the literature, and the new strip theory will be validated using prior experimental results on bifurcations from the PI?s prior work and the literature.  The issues to be addressed in this work are relevant to research areas such as the incompatible elasticity of soft and other materials, design of programmable elastomeric and structured sheets, and instabilities and bifurcations of flexible components.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

District cooling systems are a more efficient, cost-effective way to produce chilled water across campuses compared to traditional building air conditioning units. Fouling accumulation in DC systems is an inevitable byproduct of environment, water source, and operating conditions; it contributes to inefficiencies that lead to increased power costs. This project’s aim is to improve the understanding and analysis of fouling using a machine learning, algorithm-based system performance indicator (SPI) in conjunction with a nanomaterial that reduces fouling accumulation and improves heat transfer. The SPI will provide value to DC operators by enabling them to be proactive instead of reactive in their maintenance protocols, which will improve the efficiency of their cooling systems and reduce their operating costs. Together, this innovative technology package will optimize DC operations and contribute to reduced energy demand and emissions. An average size DC plant can realize an estimated savings of $300,000 annually.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to improve the efficiency of district cooling (DC) systems by increasing their system analysis capabilities through the following activities: 1) Integrate machine learning techniques into DC system data analysis to generate a system performance indicator (SPI). Instead of signaling that fouling has already occurred, the SPI will predict fouling onset to signal the need for retreatment with the nanomaterial and conduct other maintenance.  2) Optimize a system by integrating additional sensors for system performance diagnostics. The proposed project will conduct verification and validation for a system that could retrofit a single diagnostic sensor in the absence of a full sensor suite.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To meet it, business, industry, and government need well-prepared technicians who can prevent, detect, and investigate cybersecurity breaches. The growth of cyber-threats has created a need for many more workers who have the knowledge and skills to protect digital infrastructure. For example, in Boulder County, Colorado, the location of this project, an analysis in 2019 found more than 800 open cybersecurity positions. In this project, Front Range Community College and St. Vrain Valley School District, along with industry partners, will collaborate to develop and implement a Pathways in Technology Early College High School (P-TECH) program in cybersecurity.  This project is expected to build a diverse pipeline of cybersecurity technicians to address the significant regional workforce shortage. The P-TECH model was pioneered in 2011 by the New York City Public Schools in partnership with IBM and the New York City College of Technology.  The P-TECH model provides students with a high school diploma, an associate degree in a high-demand technical field, and significant industry work experience, at no cost. Front Range Community College, St. Vrain Valley School District, and IBM launched the first P-TECH program in the western United States in 2016, focused on the field of computer information systems.  This project will develop a new P-TECH program in cybersecurity.  A primary goal is to provide underrepresented students, including first-generation college students, minority students, and girls, with a strong pathway into the technology industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new cybersecurity P-TECH program will be implemented through a partnership involving Front Range Community College, St. Vrain Valley School District, and several major companies. With college coursework beginning in students' 9th Grade year, this project will provide participants with a high school diploma, an associate degree with a concentration in cybersecurity, and significant industry experience, all within four to six years and at no cost to the students. The project will serve two cohorts of 30 students over the project period, with the intent of expanding cohort size to 50-60 students beginning in 2023. When full capacity is reached (after the end of this award), the program is expected to enroll approximately 200-250 students and graduate approximately 50 new technicians annually. The course of study within the program will be co-developed with the industry partners to address industry's skill needs.  Students will receive significant work-based learning opportunities, including work site visits, mentoring by industry professionals, and paid internships. Upon graduation from the program, students will have the skills and competencies, including ""soft skills,"" necessary to successfully transition to a cybersecurity position at one of the partnering companies. Because the P-TECH model is still relatively new, this project will also provide an opportunity to study this holistic approach to technician education, which brings together K-12, postsecondary, and industry partners to collaboratively deliver a rigorous and applied course of study in one of the country's most in-demand technical fields.

2001676.xml,Doctoral Dissertation Dissertation Award: Status Related Resource Distribution,NSF,2020-03-01,2023-02-28,27271,"The Spanish colonization of the Americas had profound impacts on indigenous societies, but archaeological research has documented both change and continuity in economic, social, and political structures during the 16th and 17th centuries, implying a diversity of interactions and responses. This project uses zooarchaeology, the study of archaeological animal remains, to evaluate the impact of Spanish colonialism on households. Building on previous site-level investigations, this study considers continuities and transformations in the access to animal resources by specific community members as they adapted to the new Colonial order. Zooarchaeology is well placed to study periods of culture contact because animals can serve not only as basic resources, but also as indicators of cultural identity, luxury items, and symbols of status and power display. Thus, their material remains in the archaeological record provide a proxy of the past economic, social, and political systems in which they were used. In this study, the application of innovative zooarchaeological techniques provides a refined view of animal use by householders of different social status and political authority through the period of Spanish contact. In turn, this offers insight into the role played by status and political standing in how people react and adapt to times of instability. The project also incorporates methodological advancements by (1) presenting a new method combining taphonomy (the study of post-depositional histories of archaeological remains), skeletal element refitting, and radiocarbon dating to resolve issues of poor stratigraphic and chronological resolution; and (2) using a multi-isotope approach to investigate animal trade and management practices from pre-Columbian to Colonial times. Through museum exhibits and academic and public talks this project will generate discussions on the retention and loss of indigenous political economy in marginal areas. This research project will also train undergraduate students in methods of identification and analysis of zooarchaeological remains through hands-on lab activities. <br/><br/>To document change or persistence in cultural practices in marginal communities under Spanish rule, zooarchaeological remains are studied in two steps. First, taphonomic, refitting, and radiocarbon data are used to refine the chronology of deposits from seven households. Second, differences in the access to and control over animal resources and related activities are identified by comparing taxonomic, skeletal, and isotopic data among contexts (elite vs. non-elite, ruler vs. ruled) and periods (pre-Columbian vs. Colonial). Together, these lines of evidence will allow one to determine (1) if the elite maintained their status and power by retaining access to valued animal resources; and (2) if non-elite community members developed new strategies of animal exploitation to adapt to the Colonial order. Overall, these analyses will document relations of production and distribution of animal resources in Spanish borderlands and assess the impact of Spanish colonialism on the pursuit of these activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, most of these models have focused on STEM degree completion at four-year institutions.  This project will adapt these baccalaureate pipeline models to a two-year IT technician education program. Project activities will include improving gateway courses through strong industry connections and experiential learning.  The improvements will be designed to lessen culturally grounded barriers and self-limiting behaviors.  The project expects to develop an effective and replicable model for improving the success of students, particularly underrepresented students, and thus contribute to the quality and diversity of the nation's IT workforce.<br/><br/>This project includes a partnership between the University of Florida Institute of Higher Education and Indian River Community College.  The overall goal is to increase the enrollment and persistence of students, especially women and underrepresented minority students, in IT programs of study.

Despite this warmer surface temperature, carbon dioxide concentrations were similar to forecasts of the coming decades while the configuration of continents on the global was quite similar to present-day. Therefore, this period of warmer climate may provide a useful benchmark to understand future climate change. The scientific results of this research will help clarify the impacts of warming on the South American Monsoon System may have on millions of people that presently depend on it for water resources. Through a series of large public lectures, this project will also increase awareness about the power of climate models for informing on future climate and environmental change. Furthermore, the project will provide content for undergraduate- and graduate-level courses and help grow the nascent Department of Geosciences at the University of Connecticut (UConn). With the potential impacts of this new data and the associated educational components, this project stands to significantly benefit society.<br/><br/>Although understanding of the climate of this Miocene Climatic Optimum (MCO) is well documented through a variety of proxy records, the continental record remains poorly resolved. This data gap hinders our ability to distinguish the temperature responses between land and sea, and thus, limits our ability to use the MCO as an analog for future climate change. This project will therefore analyze the record of paleoclimate from the Central Andes preserved in the geochemistry, palynology, physical sedimentology and paleontology of ancient sand seas and paleo river and lake deposits at key localities in NW Argentina. The research team will combine this effort with a series of Miocene sensitivity experiments with the Community Earth System Model to test if CO2 driven warming is able to produce the geochemical and paleoenvironmental data or if other mechanisms, such as Antarctic ice volume and orbital changes, are required.

Adaptive learning software works by automatically measuring how much students have learned about the topic, as well as their learning process and experiences, and then adjusting the instruction accordingly. This project will investigate potential ways in which adaptive learning software might be biased against students from certain groups, and how such biases can be reduced. Adaptive learning offers an opportunity to provide high quality instruction that is personalized to the needs of individual learners, but little is known about who benefits most from adaptive learning technologies. This project will address this issue by observing and interviewing students who use adaptive math learning software to discover what aspects of their identity are most salient in the adaptive learning context. This project will then investigate possible algorithmic biases related to the identities that students express. Findings from the project will contribute to understanding of the most relevant aspects of student identity in adaptive learning contexts, and how those identities affect their learning experience. Finally, this project will address the biases that are identified, thereby providing a more equitable mathematics education experience for students.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern adaptive learning platforms individualize learning support and improve learner outcomes by using algorithms that are typically derived through machine learning. Previous work has studied biases in educational model accuracy for large groups (e.g., ethnic and gendered categories, urban vs. rural, etc.); however, large groups may have a great deal of heterogeneity, and little is known about which specific groups of students suffer from biases in model accuracy and why. This project will approach the problem of potential bias in three steps. First, the project will begin by collecting data on educational software usage patterns (i.e., logs of actions and classroom observations of student experiences) for students using MATHia, a math education platform used by over half a million students across the United States. As part of this data collection, students will describe their identity in open-ended survey responses and interviews, which will be analyzed to discover identity characteristics that shape their learning experiences. Second, existing machine learning models will be applied to these data to predict knowledge, engagement, and self-regulated learning behaviors, and the predictions will be analyzed to reveal cases where models are systematically biased. Third, the project will compare various pre-processing, in-processing, and post- processing methods for bias reduction, and study the effects of the improved algorithms when applied in MATHia. Results from this project will contribute to scientific understanding of the role of student identity in adaptive learning software, biases in machine learning for educational software, and the effects of applying machine learning methods for bias reduction.

The research aims to use sophisticated modern methods in algebraic geometry and number theory to produce general bounds on the number of solutions to certain Diophantine equations.  The study of Diophantine equations involves finding whole number solutions to polynomial equalities, such as when the sum of two fifth powers is again a fifth power. The study of such equations dates back almost 2,000 years and is among the most difficult problems in all of mathematics, as evidenced by the fact that it was established only 45 years ago that it is not possible to devise a general process with a finite number of operations that can decide whether a Diophantine equation has a solution.  The bounds under development in this research project, which depend only on the degree of the equation (i.e., the size of the exponents), will advance knowledge in this fundamental area of mathematics. The project also involves a middle- and high-school enrichment program, in addition to support for undergraduate and graduate education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the investigator seeks to use p-adic analysis and the Chabauty-Coleman method, along with ideas from tropical and non-Archimedean geometry, to give uniform bounds (in terms of the genus) on the number of rational points on hyperbolic curves satisfying certain conditions, refining earlier results. These conditions generally involve a constraint on the Mordell-Weil rank. Using related methods, he will also attempt to prove the uniform Manin--Mumford conjecture, which gives a uniform bound (again in terms of the genus) on the size of a torsion packet on a hyperbolic curve over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Ideally this result would be unconditional; as a first step, the principal investigator will treat Mumford curves and curves with compact-type reduction."

Federated learning (also known as, collaborative learning) techniques work across multiple decentralized edge devices and/or servers holding local data samples and facilitate training of the algorithms by exchanging parameters (i.e., weights associated with deep networks) instead of the actual data samples. Federated learning over wireless networks is challenging because of data loss associated with the communication characteristics. The goal of this project is to provide their critically needed augmented intelligence by enabling federated learning at the wireless edge, via an innovative framework, named coded computing. The societal impact of democratizing machine learning on low cost edge devices is also expected to be vast.

This project leads to the development of theory and algorithms for federated machine learning over wireless that are driven by fundamental principles informed by coding and information theory. In particular, this project holistically addresses the challenges of (i) wireless bandwidth costs, (ii) resiliency to wireless outages, (iii) security, and (iv) prioritizing user data privacy that is critical for large-scale user participation in wireless edge computing. Another key aspect of wireless networks is that mobile users join and leave the network arbitrarily, and user locations can change frequently.

This project aims to address this need, as well as to help develop a deeper understanding of WT career pathways.  To do so, the project team will investigate the experiences and perceptions of WT students who begin their education and training at community colleges and the expectations of WT faculty, higher education administrators, and employers.  The purpose of this exploratory research study is to: (1) identify personal/social/life factors that affect the career pathways of WT students and their decision to obtain credentials (associate degrees, certificates) and matriculate into a four-year program; (2) identify obstacles and issues that contribute to WT student attrition; and (3) create materials and activities to support retention, associate degree attainment, and matriculation into a 2+2 program in welding technology.   The project is a collaboration between researchers and technician educators from the University of Michigan, Macomb Community College, Monroe County Community College, and Wayne State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guided by a conceptual framework that draws on the work of Hisrchy, Bremer, and Castellano (2011) and Phelps and Prevost (2012), this qualitative and quantitative exploratory mixed methods research project is guided by the overarching question: What are the factors and experiences associated with the career pathways of welding technology students?  The research team will investigate (1) specific welding technology program features (e.g., articulated dual-credit high school courses, internships, etc.) that are associated with optimal student outcomes (e.g., retention, degree completion, matriculation, employment).  They will also examine ways in which key stakeholders (e.g., faculty; administrators) can use the findings to inform strategic program improvement and decision-making.  Thematic analysis of qualitative data will be applied to uncover and test the elements of the career pathways framework.   Survey data will be analyzed using analysis of variance to test the mean differences and interaction effects that may occur among variables/elements of the career pathways framework.  This approach will identify non-significant and significant differences across different groups of students, variables, and institutions and provide insights into the phenomenological aspects of education and career development.

2001254.xml,"Arc Spaces, Singularities, and Motivic Integration",NSF,2020-08-01,2024-07-31,276582,"The research in this project explores the local geometry of algebraic varieties at their singular (non-manifold) points. A classical way of studying singularities it to restrict to a small neighborhood and analyze its boundary. In an influential paper written in the sixties, John Nash proposed an alternative approach which relies on the analysis of the space of germs of curves through the singular locus. Twenty years later, Vladimir Berkovich developed a general theory of non-Archimedean geometry which provides, among other things, a yet new approach to study singularities. These three very different points of view are in fact closely related to each other. The goals set in this project address different open problems in each of these areas, seeking new connections and applications. The project also provides research training activities for graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The space of arcs of an algebraic variety provides the underlying space in motivic integration and has been used to study invariants of singularities in the minimal model program. The first part of the project sets two distinct objectives regarding arc spaces. The first pertains a theorem of Drinfeld, Grinberg, and Kazhdan of the formal neighborhood of the arc space at non-degenerate arcs and addresses the question whether the stated decomposition globalizes along a suitable stratification of the arc space. The second objective concerns the Nash problem on families of arcs through the singularities of a variety: the Nash problem has recently been settled for surfaces in characteristic zero and there are several results in higher dimensions, but little is known in positive characteristic, even in dimension two, and the proposal addresses this case. A third objective sees the continuation of ongoing work devoted to the development of a theory of motivic integration on the Berkovich analytification of an algebraic variety and aims to understand its connections with other existing theories of integration such as Kontsevich's motivic integration, p-adic integration, and Hrushovski-Kazhdan’s integration. The fourth and last objective is motivated by the Lipman–Zariski conjecture, and aims to use ideas from prior works on links of isolated singularities and the complex Plateau problem to set up a new approach toward the conjecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000288.xml,Singularities in Harmonic Analysis and the Calculus of Variations,NSF,2020-07-01,2023-06-30,178483,"Harmonic analysis and the calculus of variations are two of the oldest branches of mathematical analysis. Harmonic analysis is the study of the scale invariant properties of functions such as the oscillation of violin strings; it underpins much of modern image and signal processing. The calculus of variations is the study of energy minimizers; for example, a soap film hanging off a wire forms a shape which minimizes the surface tension. The purpose of this project is twofold: first to use harmonic analysis to study the behavior of energy minimizers under perturbations (like a soap film in a mild wind). Second, to use techniques from the calculus of variations to study a central problem in harmonic analysis, namely how does diffusion (i.e. heat spreading through a room) detect geometry. This synergy should not only lead to mathematical breakthroughs but also refine our ability to use these mathematical ideas to predict physical phenomena. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The investigator is interested in singularities of minimizers (places where the minimizer fails to be smooth, like the corners soap bubbles form when they touch each other). In particular, the investigator wants to develop tools to study these singularities which are persistent under perturbations (either of the energy or the initial conditions). To develop these tools, new ideas from harmonic analysis and geometric measure theory are necessary. The investigator is also interested in the problem of how solutions to elliptic differential equations (which model diffusion) detect the geometry of domains in Euclidean space. Recently, there have been major breakthroughs showing that homogeneous diffusion can detect some geometric features. The investigator believes that ideas from the calculus of variations can extend this breakthrough to understand what finer geometric details inhomogeneous diffusion can detect.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This work takes fundamental understanding of functional solids in a new direction and also opens opportunities for new technologies. The materials under study can potentially trap large amounts of gas at room temperature and pressure, and then release the gas on warming. For a given volume, they can contain more gas than the high pressure storage tanks typically used to contain hydrogen, helium and other industrially important gases. Efficient and safe gas storage is one of the major barriers to using hydrogen as a fuel. The new gas-containing materials also have potential for gas separation and purification processes that are of importance to the nuclear industry and national defense. Computer simulations, which make use of a machine learning approach, support and guide the experimental work. The training of graduate and undergraduate students in a variety of techniques that are of wide utility in the development of new functional materials is integrated into the project, which is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program within the Division of Materials Research. <br/><br/>Parts 2: Technical Summary<br/>This project explores the preparation and properties of perovskites where a small gas molecule or atom, for example molecular hydrogen, neon or helium, is a structural component of the material. While there is vast body of prior work on perovskites, due to their technological significance across a wide range of applications, there is almost nothing known about gas-containing perovskites. Materials of this type can contain the gas at much higher densities than found in conventional high pressure gas storage tanks, and the small pores within their structures may enable isotope separation by quantum sieving effects.  Synthetic approaches include three distinct strategies for preparing new materials in different compositional families.  High pressure diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, along with gas release measurements from recovered samples, provide information on the formation and properties of the materials.  In this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program within the Division of Materials Research, experiment is complemented by advanced computational tools, so that computation both explains experimental results and guides the preparation of new materials. Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations, based on force fields derived from density functional theory calculations using a deep-learning convolution neural network approach, provide an opportunity to realistically capture the behavior of the materials. The training of graduate and undergraduate students in a variety of synthetic, computational and materials characterization techniques is integrated into the work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

He will study the structures and properties of disks, which are formed when clouds of gas and dust in space collapse to form protostars.  Observational evidence suggests that planets and their precursors are formed very early during the onset of star formation, and the results from this project will allow astronomers to understand just how soon planet formation begins.  Along with this research, Sheehan will conduct a summer educational program designed to provide experience in programming, data analysis, and astronomical research to high school students.<br/><br/>Recent observations of substructures in protoplanetary disks surrounding nearly every 1-5 Myr-old pre-main sequence star suggest that these disks may already have undergone a significant amount of planet or planetesimal formation. To understand the initial conditions before significant dust processing or planet formation has occurred, this project will investigate the structures of younger disks (< 1 Myr old) and their central protostars using observations done at very high angular resolution from centimeter to submillimeter wavelengths. The observations will include every known protostellar disk in the Taurus star-forming region, enabling Sheehan to place constraints on the structure of gas and dust and on the growth of early dust grains. Sheehan will also use high-resolution imaging to study a known population of young disks in the Orion star-forming region with substructures possibly related to early planet formation. Finally, he will directly measure the dynamical masses of young protostars to place these disks within the context of their stars and place robust constraints on pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks.  This project will generate the largest sample of directly measured protostellar masses, and the measurements will provide information on how disk mass depends on protostellar mass. The resulting comprehensive picture will advance our understanding of the potential for planet formation in disks, as well as the precise location of the forming planets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, it remains a persistent source of difficulty for many students, with implications for the understanding of number words by preschoolers and even the learning of algebra in middle school. The main goal of this project, led by researchers at the University of California, San Diego, and Brown University, is to understand the social and cognitive factors in early childhood that affect 4- to 5-year-olds’ learning of the concept. Specifically, the researchers will investigate how children reason about numerical equality prior to the acquisition of formal symbols (i.e., numbers and the equal sign), whether this initial understanding is affected by their developing intuitions about fairness, and how their informal intuitions about numerical equality and fairness supports the learning of symbolic representations of mathematical equality in formal early childhood education settings. The investigation of these ideas will create a research foundation that could lead to changes in early childhood mathematical education. The project is jointly funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning, and by the Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12), which supports the research and development of innovative resources, models and tools in order to enhance STEM learning and teaching by pre-K-12 students and teachers.<br/><br/>Researchers will examine the developmental origins of children’s understandings of the core mathematical concept of equality. They will conduct a series of behavioral studies that will range from behavioral observations to experiments to learning interventions. In one set of studies, they will assess children’s ability to evaluate whether two quantities are equal when they use a strategy that does not require knowing number words or formal mathematical symbols. The researchers will then test whether children are more likely to use this strategy when they are motivated by a social concern: a desire to make sure valuable resources are shared fairly. They will also test whether the ability changes as children learn numerical symbols (e.g., number words). Finally, researchers will test a learning intervention that involves their leveraging their intuitive understandings of equality, addition, and subtraction together with their motivation to ensure fairness. They hypothesize that such an approach will help children to understand the meaning of formal expressions (e.g., “9 + 1 = 10”) that they might otherwise simply memorize and solve by rote. By connecting children’s social and numerical intuitions with understanding of symbolic math, the project will address a central challenge in mathematics education that has important implications for early childhood education practices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Manufacturing companies using high-value ingredients are facing the problem of loss of bioactive ingredients during processing. The proposed innovation can reduce the loss by protecting bioactive components from the environmental stresses products experience during processing, transport, and storage, thus increasing economic value, improving food sustainability, and improving efficacy. Furthermore, the technology can also increase the absorption of health-promoting components into the human body, thereby increasing their efficacy. The proposed innovation provides a safe and cost-effective method of improving the bioavailability of bioactive agents through oral administration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on an encapsulation technology utilizing food-grade biopolymers to create cross-linked protective membranes around bioactive-loaded food particles. Advantages include the ability to endure environmental stresses such as extreme pH values, high salt concentrations, freezing and thawing; and improving the bioavailability and absorption of bioactive compounds from food. Food-grade ingredients can be used to assemble colloidal delivery systems to protect bioactives from the harsh conditions foods experience during their shelf life as well as during passage through the gastrointestinal tract.  Moreover, they can be used to target bioactive agents to specific tissues. For instance, preliminary studies have shown that the bioaccessibility of curcumin can be increased by 80% using the proposed technology compared with existing products on the market. The proposed technology can therefore increase efficacy, reduce costs, and extend the shelf life of health-promoting functional foods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many minority groups continue to be underrepresented in science careers, limiting their opportunities to pursue potential science trajectories and diminishing benefits to society from diverse perspectives. Science learning environments, however, often do not build on or recognize the lives of students resulting in persistent marginalization. This, in turn, can lead minoritized youth to identify negatively with science and decreases their interest and success in science. Drawing on current research about increasing interest in and relevance of science for students, this project will explore how to promote positive identity development and science understandings aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards. The project team will develop and study a learning environment that engages middle school students in addressing health-related problems in their own community. The team will collaborate with seventh grade students, their teachers, and community members to develop community-based science instruction. Students will draw on research within their own communities and use powerful technology tools to explore and explain the underlying biological and environmental causes of these problems. Using these resources, students will also create solutions for their communities. The project will contribute theoretical insights, a set of principles to inform future instructional design, professional development for teachers and will report their findings in journals, conferences, and a project website.<br/><br/>Using a participatory design approach, this project aims to deepen the understanding of how to support minoritized youth in three interlinked aspects critical for success in school science and beyond: authoring science-linked identities, negotiating science epistemologies, and learning life science core ideas and practices. Through two consecutive implementation studies, the project team will investigate how a set of design principles related to these aspects shapes students’ science-linked identities and understandings of science practices and core disciplinary ideas. They will work in middle school biology classrooms and collaborate with administrators, teachers, students, and community members to design meaningful and consequential instruction for minoritized youth. In particular, they hope to better understand how to support science learning while inviting and integrating multiple epistemologies and student-salient identities. The outcomes will contribute theoretical insights about how interactions between epistemic agency and community-based consequential learning support identity work as well as science understandings; educative instructional materials that can be adapted to other communities and contexts; professional materials that can be used to support enactment of community-based learning environments; and adaptations of materials that can be used in teacher preparation programs.

This quantum information can propagate between individual nodes containing single atoms, including artificial atoms.  The transfer of quantum information between single photons and single atoms in the network can be exploited to implement secure communication and to solve computational problems that would otherwise be difficult with conventional computers.  This experimental project aims to demonstrate this transfer process by developing and using an experimental platform, in which special defect centers in an otherwise perfect diamond crystal are used as artificial atoms.  Single defect centers are coupled to light pulses that are confined in dimensions less than 50 micrometers.  This spatial confinement greatly increases the light intensity that can be generated by a single photon and thus enhances its coupling to the defect center.  A specific goal is to transfer quantum information from one defect center to another via this enhanced coupling to single photons.  Research activities of this project also provide excellent training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in areas including nanophotonics and nanofabrication as well as quantum science and technology.  This training prepares the students for careers in academia, industry, or government. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>This project focuses on controlling optical interactions of a single spin at the level of single cavity photons via a dark state, which can mediate reversible state transfers between spins and photons, while circumventing decoherence processes such as spontaneous emission.  The project develops and explores a composite cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) system, in which negatively charged silicon vacancy (SiV) centers in a 100 nm thick diamond membrane couple to evanescent fields of optical whispering gallery modes in a silica microresonator.  The composite system can enable spin-state selective coupling to the cavity mode as well as the realization of the good cavity limit, in which the cavity linewidth is small compared with the single-photon dipole coupling rate.  Electromagnetically induced transparency will be used to probe and characterize the dark state of the composite cavity QED system.  The dark state will then be exploited for reversible state transfers between spins and photons, studies of higher energy ladder states of the cavity QED system, and cavity-mediated coherent interactions between two SiV spins.<br/><br/>This Division of Materials Research (DMR) grant supports research to understand composite cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) systems with funding from the Condensed Matter Physics (CMP) program in DMR, the Atomic, Molecular, and Optics (AMO) program in the Division of Physics (PHY), and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will contribute to the optimization literature, the field of operations research, and links between operations research and IT security.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; This project supports forward-looking, dynamic defensive strategies in uncertain environments that have the potential to achieve high levels of security without a corresponding increase in costs. To achieve this goal, this project explores how an optimization framework can be used to prescribe dynamic protection and response policies that protect IT systems, are effective given uncertain future events, and reduce risk in complex environments that span people, processes, and infrastructure.  The project adds new models to the literature that draw from integer programming, multi-stage stochastic programming, adversarial risk analysis, and network games. Solving these models is extremely challenging, and therefore, this research explores new algorithmic techniques to identify optimal and near-optimal model solutions. This project advances our understanding of how to dynamically allocate resources to secure IT systems in an uncertain environment. This project integrates research with education to train the future workforce in cybersecurity. A comprehensive plan for broadening participation in computing highlights the researchers' efforts and commitment to diversity and inclusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project focuses on developing energy and spectrum-efficient, distributed multi-access strategies for dynamic and large-scale wireless networks under the stringent energy and delay requirements that are expected in emerging applications. This work will enable the development of a multitude of technologies that can improve the life of society-at-large. For example, this work can support the next generation of communication technologies for large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) applications and autonomous vehicle applications. Moreover, education is a core component of this project. New theories and algorithms developed in this project are integrated into the graduate-level courses at the three universities. Undergraduate and graduate students are involved in the project through the undergrad capstone and masters graduation projects at the Ohio State University.<br/><br/>This project explores the fundamental energy and spectrum-efficiency tradeoff of distributed spectrum access methods, and develops adaptive and correlated strategies that embrace and control randomness with efficiency guarantees for dynamic users with delay-sensitive traffic. In addition, the design incorporates humans into the loop by observing how humans react in simple multi-access games, providing simple human behavior models and simple human-perceived quality metrics, and by designing methods that can adapt to unexpected events or actions. A combined analysis and implementation approach of this project exploits high-dimensionality in the system while also overcoming difficulties for large-scale implementation and testing. In particular, the project develops mean-field techniques and analyses for large-scale spectrum access. Novel real-world experimentation strategies developed in this project emulate large-scale system operation in a small testbed by utilizing the simplification due to our randomized solutions and the integration of the aforementioned mean-field methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

First, transport of electricity without dissipation in a superconducting state is a fundamental topic addressed here by investigating a wide group of superconductors to determine the mechanism of superconductivity unambiguously. Second, the other half of this project focuses on topological insulators, a novel class of quantum matter harboring protected conducting states at their surfaces. How this novel property emerges is not yet understood when the interactions are strong. To tackle this unsolved problem, this project applies tunneling spectroscopy to multiple candidate materials in different forms and under hydrostatic pressure. Younger generation of scientists including graduate and undergraduate students are actively involved in this project by undertaking key experimental activities and trained to acquire professional skills such as written and verbal dissemination of their work. Outreach to underrepresented group is planned, as well as engagement in various activities focusing on elevating general public’s literacy in STEM fields.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract: This project involves two forefront research topics in condensed matter physics: the pairing mechanism in the 1-1-5 family of heavy-fermion superconductors and the interplay between strong correlations and topology in correlated topological materials. Electron tunneling spectroscopy is employed to reveal their key spectroscopic properties that are essential for microscopic understanding of the underlying physics. Despite the widely accepted pairing mechanism involving spin fluctuations in heavy-fermion superconductors, key experimental signatures for the 1-1-5 family of heavy fermions remain controversial/missing. The resultant spectroscopic information is expected to lead to a deepened understanding of the interplay between strong correlations and topology. Younger generation of scientists including graduate and undergraduate students are actively involved in this project by undertaking key experimental activities and trained for acquiring professional skills such as written and verbal dissemination of their work.

This digital database allows researchers to quickly and efficiently study morphological patterns across all vertebrate groups. One of the most apparent differences among vertebrates is their body size, with some species obtaining large body sizes, while others remain very small even as mature adults. This Partner to Existing Networks (PEN) award will link the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County with oVert to create a digital repository of data focusing on some of the world’s smallest vertebrates: cryptobenthic fishes. Fishes represent approximately half of the total vertebrate diversity, yet many groups remain understudied. Cryptobenthic fishes, which are small marine fishes that live in a variety of habitats, are one of these understudied groups and their importance in marine ecosystems is only beginning to be understood. This project will complement oVert taxonomically by focusing on an understudied vertebrate group, and methodologically by developing best practices for scanning very small organisms for both bony and soft-tissue anatomy. In addition to their research utility, these scans will be an excellent educational resource that will be incorporated into public museum displays and K-12 classroom lesson plans. Furthermore, processing of CT scans will train undergraduate students in skills that are used in a variety of professional disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studying very small organisms comes with inherent challenges, and previous attempts to describe the internal anatomy of small vertebrates was only possible using destructive approaches. This project will focus on 17 different fish families that comprise the majority of cryptobenthic fishes using traditional CT scans to document the skeletal system and contrast-enhanced CT scans to reveal soft-tissue anatomy such as muscle, nervous, and circulatory systems. Cryptobenthic fishes fill a variety of functional ecosystem roles, and the bony and soft-tissue scans associated with this project will create the raw data necessary for researchers to understand how these minute fishes have adapted in different ways to their environment without damaging valuable museum specimens. In combination with CT scans completed by oVert and oVert partners, the products of this project will also be useful for researchers to identify general trends in vertebrate anatomical evolution associated with body size and will be a valuable resource for the development of new questions and hypotheses in a variety of scientific disciplines. Data will be shared with and made available through iDigBio.org and MorphoSource.org.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

(Sandy) Dasgupta and his students at the University of Texas at Arlington are working to improve the performance and portability of a family of important instruments known as chromatographs.  These instruments are widely used for separating the constituents of complex mixtures, enabling further analysis of the separated components.  The underlying science of chromatography is critical for applications such as assuring the purity of reagents used in the semiconductor industry; environmental analysis (including monitoring reactive pollutants that cannot survive a long trip to the lab); monitoring water disinfection byproducts; manufacturing pharmaceuticals; and monitoring food safety. The Dasgupta group is working to make such instruments easily field-portable (small, lightweight, low-power, and low-cost) without compromising their separation capabilities.  The aim is on-site measurement in such contexts as a physician’s office or patient's bedside; industrial troubleshooting; and water-monitoring in submarines and even in the international space station. Through involvement of students ranging from junior- and senior-level high school interns through postdoctoral fellows, Professor Dasgupta is also addressing the high demand for people trained to use these techniques.  As he develops new instruments and techniques, he is incorporating them into laboratory curricula and working with instrument-makers for commercialization.<br/><br/>The Dasgupta group is using moldable ion-exchange polymers developed in the previous NSF-funded project to make ion transport-driven nonmechanical nL/min - uL/min pumps and molded microchannels to provide ultra-miniature suppressors and eluent generators. Open-channel columns with helical and 2D/3D serpentine geometries are being systematically investigated for their separations capabilities.  These columns can be fabricated by 3D printing and near-IR laser machining, making them inexpensive and amenable to mass production. The team is exploring direct photothermal and multireflection absorption measurements for sensitive detection, as well as computational techniques to reduce dispersion. Finally, they are exploring the use of porous tubes (where radial flow is induced by evaporation) and pressure-driven axial flow in the presence of a transverse, time-dependent, electric field as approaches to achieving the high separation efficiencies characteristic of microchannels while operating at higher flow rates, so that extra-column dispersion requirements are lessened.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, there is considerable uncertainty about the capacity of forests to continue providing services under altered precipitation regimes.  By making detailed measurements related to drought-induced mortality for multiple, widespread tree species, using a continental-scale forest composition data set to extrapolate these measurements across the United States, and by incorporating predictions of future rainfall patterns, this project aims to improve our ability to predict the susceptibility of forests throughout the United States to drought.  The investigators plan to make new measurements related to how low water availability in soil reduces water flow through trees, reduces rates of photosynthesis, and causes trees to die.  The planned measurements, which are associated with key traits that influence coupled carbon and water flow in trees, provide a new basis for understanding how environmental variability has given rise to the forests of today, and for predicting how the species composition of forests is likely to change in the future.  Furthermore, comparing the trait combinations of individual trees, and average trait values across species, to optimal values derived from a model enables a deeper understanding of why some species are more susceptible to drought than others.  The team, composed of plant physiologists, forest ecologists, and Earth system modelers, plans to develop new measurement and modeling techniques, and plans to publicly disseminate datasets that will be used to identify regions at particular risk to changing rainfall patterns.  In the process, the team will conduct interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate training to prepare diverse, next-generation scientists to tackle ecological and data science challenges.<br/><br/>The project team will combine a simple mechanistic vegetation model that links plant hydraulic traits to plant fitness, given local environmental conditions, and a wide range of datasets including forest community surveys from the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program, hydraulic trait databases, and new measurements of within-species variation of plant hydraulic traits. The team will aim to predict observed patterns in forest mortality at FIA plots, and across multiple long-term forest demography networks, using observed community hydraulic trait distributions and mechanistic model simulations driven by local environmental conditions. The team will identify the extent to which mortality during extreme events is dictated by community-weighted mean hydraulic traits and ecosystem hydraulic diversity. Finally, the team will apply these concepts to understand the limits of plant physiological plasticity/acclimation within a species. The project team will generate new continental-scale datasets documenting community-weighted hydraulic traits, community physiological function and community resilience. The knowledge gained will inform ecosystem management and conservation efforts, as well as future Earth system model development. The research team plans to engage local land managers about the impacts of climate on forest resilience, to incorporate undergraduate and high school researchers from local communities and underrepresented groups in STEM in project activities, and to reach out to local prison populations through an annual lecture series focused on the effects of variation in environmental conditions and terrestrial ecosystem health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In response to this workforce demand, the project team will develop and test an adaptive virtual reality (VR) platform to help manufacturing technician students learn business communication skills.  The platform will deliver interactive case studies that allow students to practice business communication skills needed in a smart factory context.  To support integration of these adaptive VR case studies within courses, faculty in advanced manufacturing programs will participate in extensive professional development as they collaboratively develop new VR business communication case studies.  In addition, the project will support faculty externships in industry to enhance their knowledge of current trends, skills requirements, new tools, and career opportunities in advanced manufacturing.

Some examples of quantum materials include high-temperature superconductors, two layers of carbon atom sheets on top of each other with a relative twist angle, and materials in which the electron-electron interaction energies are much larger compared to their kinetic energies. These systems typically have many scientifically interesting and technologically important properties that emerge collectively from the complex interactions of their constituent entities as a whole. While the specific properties of quantum materials depend sensitively on their structure and quantum chemistry, certain emergent properties, such as high-temperature superconductivity, can be understood from a more general quantum statistical mechanical perspective. The advantage of such a perspective is its generality, and ideally the promise that it could lead to mathematically well-controlled solutions to paradigmatic models that can serve as the framework for a qualitative understanding of the properties of interesting materials. In this project, the principle investigator will study an array of such atomic scale models on material systems and topics that are at the heart of contemporary condensed matter physics.<br/><br/>Recent advances in the theory of quantum materials have had, and will continue to have, both practical and conceptual implications beyond physics. The issues involved in this project are central across a broad range of subfields of physics including the traditional study of quantum materials in a condensed matter context, studies of strongly interacting matter in a string theory and quantum gravity context, studies of cold atom condensates in atomic-molecular-and-optical physics context, and as a venue for exploring and exploiting new ideas in quantum information theory. More generally, quantum materials play an important role in a range of more applied sciences, and hence, increased understanding of the problems to be investigated in this project has the potential to influence broader developments in science and technology as well. Students and postdocs, who will be involved in this research, are likely to develop into future leaders of the field, while those who do not continue in physics will nonetheless develop skills which will allow them to make contributions to society in a broader context.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports theoretical research on atomic scale models of interacting electrons and ions in quantum materials on several fronts. One focus is on the microscopic mechanisms that give rise to the various broken symmetry phases that populate the low temperature reaches of the phase diagrams of such materials, especially superconductivity and charge density waves. The research will focus on the significant non-universal, but robust, properties that determine the basic energy and temperature scales which characterize these phases, including transition temperatures. Another focus of interest are transport properties of strongly interacting systems in regimes of temperature and interaction strengths in which the quasiparticle paradigm breaks down. While the breakdown of the Fermi liquid paradigm is apparent in a variety of experimentally interesting material systems, it is likely that not all non-Fermi-liquid metals are the same. An important goal is to identify basic features that allow such states to be identified more by what they are than by what they are not, and to make progress on understanding these behaviors by identifying solvable model problems that exhibit similar properties. Finally, an important component of the research will be a continuation and extension of earlier studies of the universal properties of systems near a quantum critical point at which the nature of the ground-state order changes qualitatively, such as in quantum critical phenomena in metallic systems. <br/><br/>Recent advances in the theory of quantum materials have had, and will continue to have, both practical and conceptual implications beyond physics.

The third meeting is tentatively planned for April 2021.  One of the first or third meetings will take place at Duke University; the other meeting will take place at the Armstrong Campus of Georgia Southern University.  Further information on these meetings including the locations, dates, lists of speakers, lists of participants, and registration information will be linked to the conference home pages as it becomes available: http://www.math.sc.edu/~boylan/seminars/pantshome.html and http://www.math.clemson.edu/~kevja/SERMON. The meetings consist of participant talks on current research in all areas of number theory, including analytic number theory, arithmetic geometry, and automorphic and modular forms. These topics reflect the research interests of number theorists working in the Southeast. Each meeting features plenary talks by nationally and internationally recognized leaders in the field, invited talks by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and a larger number of contributed talks by mathematicians at all levels including undergraduate and graduate students, and junior and senior faculty. Number theorists from outside the Southeast will give the invited and plenary talks, while regional researchers will give most of the contributed talks. <br/> <br/>A primary goal of the Southeastern Number Theory Meetings is to provide members of the number theory community in the Southeast with an opportunity to learn about new and significant research in number theory and to disseminate their own research. Students and junior researchers in the community particularly benefit from the meetings. The meetings strengthen their knowledge base, expose their work to a wider audience, and give them insightful input and feedback from other participants. Funding from the NSF allows the organizers to achieve their goals at a low cost to individual participants. These meetings integrate regional mathematicians into the community who may have little or no funds for professional travel such as graduate students and faculty at institutions that do not award Ph.Ds. The organizers will continue efforts to attract a demographically diverse participant base including women and racial and ethnic minorities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000105.xml,Entropy Theory Methods in von Neumann Algebras,NSF,2020-06-01,2024-05-31,175000,"Quantum mechanics is an area of physics with numerous applications including biology and engineering. A basic consequence of the theory is that observables cannot commute with each other, and so the mathematical basis for quantum mechanics must be within a noncommutative framework. Based on this constraint, in the 1930's Murray and von Neumann provided a rigorous background for quantum mechanics using algebras of operators on a Hilbert space now called von Neumann algebras. Recently, these objects have provided a precise framework in which to study quantum computing, which has enormous potential application to breakthroughs in cryptography. Another area where von Neumann algebras have given tremendous insight is in the study of random matrices. Random matrices themselves are used in nuclear physics to model the nuclei of heavy atoms, as well as in theoretical neuroscience to describe the connections between neurons in the brain. This project will also contribute to US workforce development through diversity initiatives and training of graduate students.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to study group von Neumann algebras through two different approaches: Voiculescu's free probability theory, and Popa's deformation/rigidity theory. In Voiculescu's free probability theory, the PI plans to use the theory of random matrices to attack a well-known conjecture of Peterson and Thom on the structure of subalgebras of group von Neumann algebras of free groups. The random matrix approach uses so-called strong convergence, which demands that eigenvalue distributions converge weak*, and that the spectrum converges in the Hausdorff metric.   Building on the 1-bounded entropy theory due to the PI and Jung, the PI establishes that if a natural strong convergence results holds for tensors of random unitaries, then one is able to deduce the Peterson-Thom conjecture as a corollary. Importing insight from sofic entropy theory into Popa's deformation/rigidity theory, the PI recently showed with de Santaigo-Hoff-Sinclair that given a (s-malleable) deformation of a tracial von Neumann algebra, and a diffuse, rigid subalgebra, one can necessarily extend it to a maximal rigid subalgebra. A potential avenue for exploration is in generalizing these results to approximately rigid subalgebra. Such a generalization gives a second approach to the Peterson-Thom conjecture. It would also provide a way to show that nonamenable groups with nontrivial cohomology in the left regular representation do not have Cartan subalgebras, a problem in the subject that has been open for the last decade. The PI also plans to study the implications of this theory to the case of von Neumann algebras of equivalence relations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They will seek answers to three core questions:  (1) To what degree does exposure to others' beliefs via social media channels affect change in a person's beliefs?  (2) How does the spread of beliefs operate over large sociotechnical networks?  (3) What is the appropriate set of computational formalisms for representing the spread of beliefs on large sociotechnical networks?  They will employ a networked cognitive systems approach to analyze the diffusion dynamics of attitudes towards electronic cigarettes on Twitter, using online social experiments, data-mining techniques, and a to-scale formal computational model of a real Twitter network.

Understanding the broader temporal and spatial patterns, timing, and amplitude of cool and warm periods across eastern North America may aid in constraining model scenarios of future temperature change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Longer temperature records (e.g. that extend beyond the instrumental period) may provide information on: (i) past and current spatiotemporal characteristics of temperature variability; (ii) the full range and amplitude of pre-instrumental temperatures; (iii) the timing and direction of temperature rate changes; and (iv) the influence of ocean and atmosphere forcing mechanisms on centennial-scale temperature variability and the sensitivity of temperature changes to these climatic forcing mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential Broader Impacts include developing data from a data poor geographic location that are well situated to advance knowledge on North American climate, supporting graduate students from underrepresented groups, and providing outreach to K-12 STEM audiences including those involving Native American communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001015.xml,Topics in Noncommutative Algebra,NSF,2020-07-01,2024-06-30,330000,"A noncommutative algebra is a fundamental concept that represents solutions  to a system of equations of several non-commuting variables. Noncommutative  algebras are frequently used to encode models for networks, communication,  quantum computing, and chemical molecules, as well as many other objects in sciences and engineering. It is generally impossible to assess a given  algebra by dealing with its elements, while invariants of an algebra capture  many key features of the algebra. Then understanding invariants becomes extremely beneficial for understanding different aspects of these algebras.  This project focuses on new invariants of noncommutative algebras that arise  from several subjects such as noncommutative projective geometry, category  theory, combinatorics, and the study of infinite dimensional Hopf algebras  or quantum groups. The principal investigator will involve graduate students and postdoctoral  fellows in this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project concerns several central topics in the field of noncommutative  algebra with connections to noncommutative geometry, combinatorics, the  representation theory of quivers and category theory. The principal investigator plans to study  several invariants of noncommutative algebras and their associated categories,  to develop foundations for new research directions, and to classify algebraic  objects that describe noncommutative spaces. Specifically the project investigates noncommutative discriminants, Frobenius-Perron dimension,  primitive cohomology, and other effective invariants and crucial structures  in noncommutative algebras, quiver representations and tensor triangulated  categories. The principal investigator continues to search for methods for the automorphism  problem, the isomorphism problem, and different versions of the cancellation  problem in noncommutative algebra. Finally one of PI's ultimate goals is to  construct new Hopf algebra domains of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension two in  positive characteristic and new tensor triangulated structures on the quiver  representations of either finite or tame representation type.  The principal investigator will train students in fields closely related to his research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The propensity for bacteria to form multicellular communities termed biofilms far exceeds the tendency to persist in suspension. Bacteria secrete and surround themselves with molecular polymers as building materials to enmesh and protect resident bacteria in slime-like assemblies. The PI’s recent work revealed the assembly of extraordinary mechanically robust basket-like architectures surrounding E. coli cells in biofilms and led to the discovery of a new chemical structure never before observed in nature within these baskets. Cellulose is the most abundant biopolymer on Earth, present in the cell walls of plants and trees, leading to wood, paper, and cotton products. Other industries also employ methods to modify standard cellulose through synthetic routes for desirable properties and are used as food additives and in membrane and biotechnology applications. E. coli produces its own uniquely modified form of cellulose with phosphoethanolamine groups through newly defined molecular machinery. This project tackles crucial questions involving nature’s phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) cellulose: its modification patterning, its physical properties and potential for application in new industrial materials, and the molecular basis for the assembly of the full polysaccharide-protein nanocomposite structures. This project will fuel new research directions with implications for bacterial physiology; glycobiology; and industrial applications including the production of new materials and uses in renewable energy. The PI communicates scientific concepts and discoveries through scientific and educational research articles targeted to broad audiences. This project will train undergraduate and graduate students, particularly those from groups under-represented in STEM. The PI is designing coursework changes to introduce more quantitative concepts and hands-on course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) into undergraduate chemistry courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will integrate biochemical analysis with characterization of polymer strength and materials properties, electron microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, solid-state NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry to: (1) deliver a fundamental understanding of the molecular patterning and physical properties of the zwitterionic phosphoethanolamine cellulose; (2) determine the influence of the cellulose modification on the Velcro-like association of curli at the bacterial cell surface; (3) define atomic-level parameters corresponding to molecular interactions between curli and pEtN cellulose in native bacterial composites in situ and highly tuned complexes formed in vitro. In addition to revealing the fundamental chemical principles underlying biofilm matrix assemblies, the work will introduce new methods for the production of pEtN cellulose and isotopically labeled matrix materials, and provide unprecedented atomic- level analysis of insoluble matrix materials that pose a challenge to analysis by conventional methods. The project may serve to reveal a new paradigm for understanding the molecular basis of other amyloid- polysaccharide interactions, prevalent not only in microorganisms but also in eukaryotic cell systems and should inspire the search for alternately modified celluloses and polysaccharides.

It is not known why this family is so diverse, but some of its interesting structural variants may have played a role. The family exhibits several unusual traits, including special structures that house ants or mites, modified floral parts, and wide variation in fruit type. The plants’ growth form also varies, ranging from annuals to shrubs to trees, and even epiphytes or vines. This project aims to explore whether any of these factors may have contributed to the extreme diversity of Melastomataceae by using genomic data to build an evolutionary tree for approximately 3000 species from the family. The researchers will then test the geographic origin and subsequent movement of the family across continents and environments, the evolution of morphological and genetic features, and associated diversification rate shifts throughout the worldwide distribution of Melastomataceae. This collaborative project represents a model for tackling speciose and widespread tropical plant radiations and will shed light on the origin and subsequent diversification of one of the largest tropical plant families on the planet. Two postdoctoral scholars and a graduate student will be trained, and the researchers will offer short training courses to a variety of students. The project’s discoveries will be highlighted in exhibits at the Florida Museum of Natural History and the New York Botanical Garden, which have a combined annual visitation of over 500,000 people.<br/><br/>Understanding the generation of tropical angiosperm diversity worldwide is often complicated by the lack of sufficient phylogenetic data for major radiations. Given its broad geographic distribution, its morphological diversity, and its size, the Melastomataceae is an ideal model for developing a comprehensive phylogenomic dataset to test geographic origins, morphological evolution, and diversification rates of a major tropical radiation, a task currently intractable based on limited global datasets. Taking a Hyb-seq approach, the project will produce phylogenomic datasets using 384 nuclear loci and entire plastomes to reconstruct the phylogeny of at least 3000 species across all major lineages of the Melastomataceae. The five principal goals of the project are to: 1) generate a robust phylogenetic hypothesis of relationships among all major groups; 2) estimate the timing of key evolutionary events and diversification rates across the family, including correlations with morphological evolution; 3) analyze biogeographic scenarios and determine the origin of the family, as well as correlations between diversification rates and major biogeographical shifts; 4) estimate the degree of polyploidy across the family using allele frequencies from our nuclear loci to infer chromosomal evolution across the tree; and 5) develop robust classifications based on our phylogenetic hypotheses, incorporating morphological characters delineating major lineages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such an institute would support the community of educators, students, and other stakeholders, with the goal of developing a workforce that is ready to meet the challenges of working with current and future computing fabrics. The investigators propose planning for such an institute (iPDC) that can help eliminate the longstanding barrier of the sequential computing paradigm such that, analogous to the establishment of the object oriented paradigm, the PDC paradigm is naturally integrated into Computer Science (CS) and Computer Engineering (CE) curricula across various institutions as recommended by the 2013 ACM/IEEE Computer Science Curricula and now by ABET.<br/><br/>Through the network of funded and unfunded collaborators, established contacts with instructors at institutions serving underrepresented groups, and outreach efforts, the project will robustly engage with stakeholder communities through four well-structured planning workshops, weekly teleconferences, and feedback and dissemination activities to formulate the key attributes of the institute.Broadening PDC education will further enable advances in science and engineering, which depend increasingly on PDC systems, by providing the next generation of practitioners and researchers with the necessary skills and knowledge to effectively exploit them.

Specifically, this project will synthesize hydroclimate records from global monsoon regions, reconstruct monsoon variability over the past 21,000 years, and form the basis of a data-model comparison. This effort will help characterize monsoon responses to changing global energy balance, develop a community database resource, and build a testbed for model improvement. This database of monsoon records (from regional to global scales) will enable the researchers to reconstruct the monsoon strength and extent, to test hypotheses linking hemispheric temperature and circulation with tropical hydroclimate, and to test how well past monsoon variability is simulated in models. These reconstructions will be used to then investigate how monsoon systems responded to the collapse of Northern Hemisphere ice-sheets, and changes in latitudinal temperature gradients.  <br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts include developing and curating a global monsoon database for the past 21 thousand years and advancing the understanding of past and future monsoon dynamics. The database will be made publicly available to the wider paleoclimate community. Other potential Broader include developing a teaching-kit and holding a teacher-training workshop to engage k-12 classrooms and teachers on local tribal nations (in Northern Arizona).

2001074.xml,Collaborative Research: CSEDI: Understanding the Role of Hydrogen and Melting in the Water Transport Across the Transition Zone-Lower Mantle Boundary,NSF,2020-07-15,2025-06-30,183998,"The aim of this project is to conduct new experimental and theoretical studies on the properties of mineral in the deep interior of Earth that will help us to understand the nature of global water circulation in Earth’s mantle. Not only on the surface, water (hydrogen) is present inside of Earth and slowly circulates. This global water circulation creates and maintains oceans on Earth. Based on a number of studies during the last a few decades, there is a clear idea about the water circulation in the shallow part of Earth’s interior. However, the nature of water circulation in the largest part of the mantle, the lower mantle, remains poorly constrained. A key in the global water circulation is the role of melting. Melting removes water from minerals to melt, and melt migrates a long distance to cause large-scale water transport. However, the nature of global water circulation in the deep mantle is very poorly understood mainly because our understanding of water in the minerals in the deep mantle is limited.  The PI team will bring together a suite of theoretical and experimental methods to address these questions, and will train both graduate and undergraduate students at three institutions on a cross-cutting research project.  The PIs will also engage in public outreach events.<br/><br/>In this new project, the water solubility in bridgmanite (dominant lower mantle mineral) will be determined under the shallow lower mantle conditions from ~660 km to ~1000 km depth, and also the role of water (hydrogen) on electrical conductivity in bridgmanite will be investigated. Experimental studies will be made on clean single crystals of bridgmanite and the hydrogen content and solubility mechanisms will be studied using FTIR and SIMS. Electrical conductivity will be measured on these samples for different orientations using the AC impedance spectroscopy. First-principle computational studies will also be made on hydrogen solubility and mobility in bridgmanite to help interpreting the experimental results. These results will help us to develop a model of global water circulation and to test models against geophysical estimates of water distribution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project from Xavier University of Louisiana, a Historically Black College/University (HBCU), seeks to explore the novelties of imidazolium-based ionic liquids that have significant potential as a “green” organic solvent for industrial applications by utilizing chemical techniques that are readily available at the institution and through collaboration with other local institutions.  Furthermore, the project is designed to include undergraduate students as active researchers while providing enhancements to existing courses by integrating the results of the proposed research within those selected courses.  Accordingly, the project has significant intellectual merit and broader impacts.<br/><br/>Imidazolium-based ionic liquids are complex spatially heterogeneous liquids. In this proposal, infrared labels, particularly the C2-D probe on the cation ring, will be used to investigate how the complex microenvironment of these ionic liquids changes in response to a change in temperature or in the presence of a solvent or a dissolved gas. Analysis of the infrared response from the C-D band, both by linear and non-linear vibrational spectroscopy, supported by computational studies is expected to provide a deep molecular-level insights into the structural reorganization of these liquids in response to external stimuli like temperature and the nature of solute-solvent interactions.

Bacteria are integral to the health of ecosystems, plants, animals, and humans, and have evolved to adapt to constantly changing conditions within their environment. However, the mechanisms by which bacteria sense and respond to changes in the levels of environmental gases are poorly understood. The research supported by this award examines the roles of environmental signals in controlling bacterial phenotypes; more specifically it examines the signaling mechanism and pathway of a family of proteins termed globin-coupled sensors that are responsible for sensing oxygen. This project provides specialized training for students in protein chemistry, spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography. Additionally, the participants in this project are integrating their research results into a board game to create lesson plans that make elementary and middle school students aware of how proteins help bacteria sense and react to changes in their environment. <br/> <br/>This research project seeks to characterize the intra- and inter-molecular protein interactions that control oxygen-dependent signaling by a family of bacterial heme proteins termed globin-coupled sensors. Globin-coupled sensor proteins are widely distributed within bacteria and contain output domains that are linked to important phenotypes, including biofilm formation, motility, and virulence. A combination of research methods that includes mutagenesis/screening, enzyme kinetics, resonance Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography is being used to interrogate the oxygen-dependent signaling mechanism within globin coupled sensor proteins and the transmission of the signaling events to downstream partners. Results from this study are expected to provide new information about bacterial gas-sensing proteins, signal transduction pathways, and regulation of key bacterial enzymatic domains involved in controlling biofilm formation and virulence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001851.xml,CHS:Small: Incorporating and Balancing Stakeholder Values in Algorithm Design,NSF,2019-08-01,2023-07-31,532000,"This project will create a general method for value-sensitive algorithm design and develop tools and techniques to help incorporate the tacit values of stakeholders, balance multiple stakeholders' values, and achieve collective goals in the development of an algorithm.  The research community has paid increasing attention to the role of human values in algorithm design and development. For example, fairness-aware machine learning research attempts to translate fairness notions into formal algorithmic constraints and develop algorithms subject to such constraints. Despite the mathematical rigor of these approaches, prior research suggests a disconnect between the current discrimination-aware machine learning research and stakeholders' realities, context, and constraints; this disconnect is likely to undermine practical initiatives. Furthermore, studies have suggested that there are often tensions among a diverse set of values relevant to the design of the algorithm.  A new general method will be developed in the context of Redesigning Wikipedia's Objective Revision Evaluation Service (ORES), a machine learning-based service designed to generate real-time predictions on edit quality and article quality, which will benefit vast numbers of people who consume the Wikipedia content either directly or indirectly through other applications.<br/><br/>There are four major goals of this research.  The first is to articulate and demonstrate a general method for creating algorithmic systems that respect and balance stakeholders' values.  The second goal is to create techniques for generating an algorithmic system's value report and explaining the value trade-offs. The third goal to create, deploy, and evaluate social and technical innovations to address fundamental trade-offs between different values.  The final goal is to design and implement improvements to ORES, which will improve a wide variety of applications that rely on ORES, and Wikipedia's content and community as a whole.  For an example of the kinds of problems that must be solved, quality control algorithms that prioritize efficiency in deleting low quality content incur the risk of undermining the motivation of contributors in peer production communities, particularly new contributors who are still learning how to contribute. To date, however, little work has been conducted to create solutions to address tensions and trade-offs between different values in algorithm design.  The research will be performed through multiple studies by stepping through the process for a diverse set of tasks, each of which will allow interaction with multiple stakeholders, who have different (and perhaps conflicting) values.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001704.xml,Doctoral Dissertation Research: Detained Potential-Associative Stigma as a Core Mechanism Behind Educational Inequality for Children of Incarcerated Parents,NSF,2020-05-01,2021-10-31,16000,"Educational inequality is a persistent issue in American life. Research examining education and intergenerational mobility has concentrated on analyzing how social class, race, and ethnicity shape educational trajectories. While parental incarceration is another characteristic that may shape educational inequality, it has been widely been ignored. This project will consider whether and how the stigma of parental incarceration contributes to inequality through differential teacher expectations and treatment. Teacher expectations and behaviors in school have implications for educational achievement and attainment, which structure the opportunities and trajectories of youth as they move into adulthood and the labor market. These implications have long-term consequences for income, social class, wellbeing, and health. Understanding how stigma affects teachers’ assessments of students of incarcerated parents and evaluations of student school work will advance research by incorporating parental incarceration into analysis of the key determinants of educational inequality. Findings from the project will inform interventions in schools and influence training of teachers, so as to support educational equality and upward mobility, thus advancing American prosperity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational inequality limits upward mobility, and the stigma of parental incarceration may influence teachers’ expectations and behaviors, which in turn influence student achievement and attainment. To explore the role of stigma in teachers’ assessments of youth and their work, this project will employ an experimental design. Eight hundred and fifty high school teachers will receive a student biography with randomly assigned parental incarceration status: paternal, maternal, or none. Then they will complete a series of tasks that relate to student academic skills and behaviors. Participants will grade and provide feedback on the student’s writing sample and evaluate the student’s competency. Then, participants will respond to questions about student behavioral incidents and create behavioral management plans. Finally, participants will respond to a series of questions about themselves and the experiment. This experiment will create qualitative and quantitative data for analysis. The quantitative data, including the writing score, length of feedback, assessment of student competency, and behavioral response questions, will be analyzed using t-tests and regression to compare the intervention groups, paternal and maternal incarceration, to the control group of no parental incarceration. The qualitative data will be analyzed using a general inductive method to explore differences in the tone, texture, and style between the intervention groups and control group. Findings from the project will inform social psychological theories of stigma, and inform sociological theories related to educational inequality and social mobility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. James T. Watson at the University of Arizona, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist examining migration and cultural change. Archaeologists often cite migration as an explanatory factor for observed patterns of cultural change. However, relatively few studies scrutinize the purported relationship between changes in material culture and the biological reality of migration. This project will directly test hypothesized migrations, using a bioarchaeological approach to examine phenotypic variation in human skeletal remains to reconstruct patterns of biological relatedness and likely ancient migration patterns. Additionally, through targeted public outreach at museums and schools serving primarily Latinx communities, as well through collaborative workshops, the project will broaden participation of historically underrepresented groups within archaeology and the social sciences.<br/><br/>This project will evaluate how and to what extent migration and cultural change were linked in the past. To test models of migration based on observed material changes in the archaeological record, the Fellow will collect dental and skeletal phenotypic data from approximately 2500 individuals curated in museums and repositories. Biodistance relationship (R) matrix and finite mixture analyses will allow the Fellow to identify past migrations at multiple scales, including large-scale population replacements, as well as small-scale individual migrants. Results will allow archaeologists and anthropologists working on similar topics to better evaluate how and to what extent migration and cultural change were linked in the past. Moreover, the time-depth provided by archaeological studies of migration provides scientists with a means of contextualizing and better understanding the long-term consequences of on-going migration processes today.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lake Anna is one of the largest freshwater reservoirs in VA. Research is needed to understand threats, manage risks, mitigate incidents, develop capabilities, and strengthen collaborations for our water safety and security. Aerial and aquatic robots will work alongside health and water quality experts from VDH and DEQ to (1) help inform their regular sampling efforts, and (2) provide critical and timely information to guide regulatory decisions.  The HAB is still going at Lake Anna, and it is expected to continue until the first freeze at the Lake. Once the first freeze occurs, most of the cyanobacteria will explode and unload a large amount of toxins, requiring further analysis.<br/><br/>Since the first report of the harmful algal boom (HAB) on Lake Anna, the bloom has reportedly intensified, and the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) has issued multiple advisories. The most recent VDH advisory (issued on Sept 20, 2019) showed the HAB extending down both northern branches of the lake. The VDH advisories are based in part on water quality data from the VA Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), which collects samples from a series of stations (GPS waypoints where a manned boat is used to collect samples by hand) across the lake. The research team will work alongside water quality experts (DEQ and VDH) to make targeted collections of the HAB at Lake Anna using aerial robots (a drone equipped with multispectral sensors to image the bloom and a device to sample the water) and aquatic robots (a remotely operated underwater vehicle equipped with underwater GPS, sensors to track the plume in situ, and a device to collect underwater samples). These samples will be analyzed for toxins and nutrients, and the data will be shared with water quality experts and members of the Lake Anna Civic Association. Based on 10 years of seasonal toxin data for Grand Lake St. Marys in Ohio, the research team hypothesize that (1) the HAB at Lake Anna, VA will continue to progress and produce high toxin levels through the coming winter months and (2) aerial and aquatic robots can identify, localize, and sample targeted areas of the HAB in the lake. The specific objectives of this project are to (1) use aerial and aquatic robots to target the HAB in Lake Anna, VA and collect samples at strategic locations; and (2) determine toxin concentrations and nutrient loads in samples collected by robots working alongside humans. This information is critical for determining time-sensitive health advisories, and for the communities of people that live in and around the lake. This work will also show the value of unmanned systems to assist stakeholders in tracking HABs in the water; resulting field-tested technology will provide decision-makers with co-robots that can provide rapid and detailed information on the dispersal of HABs in the environment.  The HAB is still going at Lake Anna, and it is expected to continue until the first freeze at the Lake. Once the first freeze occurs, most of the cyanobacteria will lyse and unload a copious amount of cyanotoxins.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2002270.xml,"Collaborative Research: Resolving the relationships of Melastomataceae, one of the world's most diverse flowering plant radiations",NSF,2020-08-01,2025-07-31,1108780,"The Melastomataceae are the eighth largest family of flowering plants on the planet with more than 5600 species, most of which grow in the New World tropics. It is not known why this family is so diverse, but some of its interesting structural variants may have played a role. The family exhibits several unusual traits, including special structures that house ants or mites, modified floral parts, and wide variation in fruit type. The plants’ growth form also varies, ranging from annuals to shrubs to trees, and even epiphytes or vines. This project aims to explore whether any of these factors may have contributed to the extreme diversity of Melastomataceae by using genomic data to build an evolutionary tree for approximately 3000 species from the family. The researchers will then test the geographic origin and subsequent movement of the family across continents and environments, the evolution of morphological and genetic features, and associated diversification rate shifts throughout the worldwide distribution of Melastomataceae. This collaborative project represents a model for tackling speciose and widespread tropical plant radiations and will shed light on the origin and subsequent diversification of one of the largest tropical plant families on the planet. Two postdoctoral scholars and a graduate student will be trained, and the researchers will offer short training courses to a variety of students. The project’s discoveries will be highlighted in exhibits at the Florida Museum of Natural History and the New York Botanical Garden, which have a combined annual visitation of over 500,000 people.<br/><br/>Understanding the generation of tropical angiosperm diversity worldwide is often complicated by the lack of sufficient phylogenetic data for major radiations. Given its broad geographic distribution, its morphological diversity, and its size, the Melastomataceae is an ideal model for developing a comprehensive phylogenomic dataset to test geographic origins, morphological evolution, and diversification rates of a major tropical radiation, a task currently intractable based on limited global datasets. Taking a Hyb-seq approach, the project will produce phylogenomic datasets using 384 nuclear loci and entire plastomes to reconstruct the phylogeny of at least 3000 species across all major lineages of the Melastomataceae. The five principal goals of the project are to: 1) generate a robust phylogenetic hypothesis of relationships among all major groups; 2) estimate the timing of key evolutionary events and diversification rates across the family, including correlations with morphological evolution; 3) analyze biogeographic scenarios and determine the origin of the family, as well as correlations between diversification rates and major biogeographical shifts; 4) estimate the degree of polyploidy across the family using allele frequencies from our nuclear loci to infer chromosomal evolution across the tree; and 5) develop robust classifications based on our phylogenetic hypotheses, incorporating morphological characters delineating major lineages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They were pulled up with nets, scooped up from seabeds with grabs, and hand-collected by divers, all contributing to a library of biodiversity that captures the state of life in the ocean - year after year, decade after decade. The broadest evolutionary scope of those collections is in the marine invertebrates, animals without backbones - sea stars, corals, worms, jellyfish, crabs, and thousands of other animals. That library of preserved marine invertebrates is our essential guide to the diversity of ocean life across the globe. And because they encapsulate data from the moment they were picked up, these institutional collections also act as a time machine, letting us use the past to understand how our present will become the future. But there is a problem - vast numbers of these specimens are essentially invisible outside of a tiny community of museum specialists. The only record of these specimens' existence is on labels enclosed in the jars with the preserved animals or in paper logbooks on a shelf. These specimens will remain nearly undiscoverable on museum shelves until their core descriptive information is made digitally available. Therefore, this project will create public digital records for over 7.5 million specimens from our nation's legacy of marine exploration, thereby making the immense investment in the specimens' acquisition available to 21st Century biodiversity and ecosystems research. Because these specimens provide a visible and tangible window into our oceans' enchanting biodiversity, this project will involve STEM educators and student educators in the digitization effort, so that they will be able to reflect their science experiences directly back to the classroom. The public will be involved virtually, by contributing transcription of specimen label data. <br/><br/>Digitization of alcohol-preserved marine specimens has never been carried out on this scale. A major challenge lies in the location of the data: written, typed, or printed on labels in the jars with the specimens. In many cases, that will require opening the jar, extracting the label, and either transcribing it directly or photographing it for later transcription - for hundreds of thousands of jars. The immediate participants in this program will digitize most or all of the marine invertebrate collections at nineteen institutions across the country, more than doubling the number of digital records for marine invertebrates in the U.S. All data will be publicly available through existing data portals, including iDigBio.org, using standardized data formats, thereby dramatically enhancing the accessibility of biodiversity data for comprehensive, systems-based analysis of ocean ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000863.xml,RAPID: MICROBIOME AND POPULATION DYNAMICS IN SCLERACTINIAN CORAL TISSUE LOSS DISEASE INFECTED CORALS IN PUERTO RICO,NSF,2019-11-15,2024-10-31,197830,"Modern coral reefs are the result of thousands of years of growth and development, but their demise is occurring at alarming rates around the World. In the Caribbean alone, over 60% of live coral cover has been lost in many reefs in just 30-40 years. Consequently, their ecological and economic benefits to coastal communities are also declining. Disease outbreaks and more intense and frequent bleaching (loss of the microalgae in coral tissues) events associated with increasing water temperatures are some of the main factors for coral reef mass mortalities. The highly infectious and deadly Scleractinian Coral Tissue Loss Disease (SCTLD), first identified in 2014 in Florida, is quickly moving through the Caribbean causing extensive mortalities across important reef-building corals. Current research is focused in after-infection events to identify the pathogen and characterize the signs, patterns and consequences of SCTLD transmission.  This study investigates coral tissues and the coral-associated bacteria communities before, during and after the infection has occurred in reefs in Puerto Rico. The societal broader impact of the project relates to the significant ecosystem services provided by coral reefs, which are threatened by SCTLD. The project will also support training of a graduate student.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Questions about etiological variability and the temporal dynamics of the microbiome in SCTLD-affected coral species remain unanswered. Specifically, this proposal addresses the following questions: (1) What are the changes in the microbiome composition and abundances of the susceptible coral species when infected with SCTLD? (2) What is the variability in virulence, prevalence and mortality within and amongst species in different phases of the infection and in different habitats? The research site is in La Parguera Natural Reserve, southwest Puerto Rico, where the research team has characterized and monitored several reefs and environmental conditions from the shore to the shelf edge since 2003. This project includes surveys of permanent transects and molecular characterization of tissue/mucus samples, and microbial communities within those, collected from healthy colonies of two to three of the most susceptible coral species (i.e., Meandrina meandrites, M. jacksoni and Orbicella faveolata) and colonies of two resistant species (i.e., Montastraea cavernosa, Porites astreoides) at the long-term monitoring site. The expected arrival of SCTLD to Puerto Rico in Fall 2019, offers the team of researchers a unique window of opportunity to capture reef biological conditions before, during and after infection to complement other research efforts to better understand the ecological dynamics, prevalence and consequences of this new deadly coral disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Utilizing this tool, he and his team seek to glean a real-time, three-dimensional ""picture"" of metals in nanoscale metal catalyst particles on an atom-by-atom basis. Many alternative fuel sources are derived from catalytic processes based on such metal nanoparticles.  New measurement methods that reveal information about the arrangement and location of metal atoms in the catalyst and how atom location and arrangement change during the chemical conversion process have great potential to enhance our fundamental understanding of catalysis in these systems.  This novel solution to a long-standing challenge may well provide new insights into the how atomic-level structure affects behavior of nanometer-sized catalysts, while also holding potential to understand how the chemical behavior of other nanoparticles is influenced by their environment over time. These new measurement methods are anticipated to lead to significant impacts on chemical reactions used in industry, ranging from those that produce chemical or pharmaceutical building blocks to those that produce alternative fuels. The use of the state-of-the-art large-scale synchrotron X-ray facilities at national laboratories trains the students to become specialists in a significant area that is underrepresented in the typical chemist's skill set. More broadly, the research educates a highly diverse group of students about the use of cutting-edge chemical measurement tools to address important scientific problems, with an emphasis on workforce development in the field of alternative fuels. Dr. Sun and his team also integrate research outcomes into the Philadelphia community and beyond through a range of education and outreach programs to students and teachers at local urban/high-need schools and Community Colleges, as well as students participating in a National Science Foundation undergraduate research program and the Temple University TUteach initiative.<br/><br/>In this project, Dr. Sun and his research team integrate small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements with ab initio modeling and calculation results to construct models of the three-dimensional (3D) geometry of uniform nanoparticles of well-defined chemical composition. This project is developing this imaging protocol to enable the study of the element-specific evolution of 3D atom distributions in bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts under working conditions. Such endeavors require two consecutive steps. First, the element-specific SAXS patterns are deconvoluted from the highly convoluted anomalous small-angle X-ray scattering (ASAXS) of bimetallic nanoparticles based on penalized regression methods. Second, an imaging protocol is being developed to determine element-specific 3D images of the composition distribution in bimetallic nanoparticles through ab initio modeling of the deconvoluted element-specific SAXS patterns. The ASAXS imaging protocol may then be applicable to in-situ ASAXS imaging through its use with working reactors, allowing for the study of the time-resolved evolution of element-specific 3D distributions of metals in bimetallic catalysts in operando.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2003017.xml,Collaborative Research: Predicting ecosystem resilience to climate and disturbance events with a multi-scale hydraulic trait framework,NSF,2020-10-01,2025-09-30,292419,"Forests provide numerous services to society and play a critical role in governing the flux of carbon between the atmosphere and the biosphere.  Currently, there is considerable uncertainty about the capacity of forests to continue providing services under altered precipitation regimes.  By making detailed measurements related to drought-induced mortality for multiple, widespread tree species, using a continental-scale forest composition data set to extrapolate these measurements across the United States, and by incorporating predictions of future rainfall patterns, this project aims to improve our ability to predict the susceptibility of forests throughout the United States to drought.  The investigators plan to make new measurements related to how low water availability in soil reduces water flow through trees, reduces rates of photosynthesis, and causes trees to die.  The planned measurements, which are associated with key traits that influence coupled carbon and water flow in trees, provide a new basis for understanding how environmental variability has given rise to the forests of today, and for predicting how the species composition of forests is likely to change in the future.  Furthermore, comparing the trait combinations of individual trees, and average trait values across species, to optimal values derived from a model enables a deeper understanding of why some species are more susceptible to drought than others.  The team, composed of plant physiologists, forest ecologists, and Earth system modelers, plans to develop new measurement and modeling techniques, and plans to publicly disseminate datasets that will be used to identify regions at particular risk to changing rainfall patterns.  In the process, the team will conduct interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate training to prepare diverse, next-generation scientists to tackle ecological and data science challenges.<br/><br/>The project team will combine a simple mechanistic vegetation model that links plant hydraulic traits to plant fitness, given local environmental conditions, and a wide range of datasets including forest community surveys from the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program, hydraulic trait databases, and new measurements of within-species variation of plant hydraulic traits. The team will aim to predict observed patterns in forest mortality at FIA plots, and across multiple long-term forest demography networks, using observed community hydraulic trait distributions and mechanistic model simulations driven by local environmental conditions. The team will identify the extent to which mortality during extreme events is dictated by community-weighted mean hydraulic traits and ecosystem hydraulic diversity. Finally, the team will apply these concepts to understand the limits of plant physiological plasticity/acclimation within a species. The project team will generate new continental-scale datasets documenting community-weighted hydraulic traits, community physiological function and community resilience. The knowledge gained will inform ecosystem management and conservation efforts, as well as future Earth system model development. The research team plans to engage local land managers about the impacts of climate on forest resilience, to incorporate undergraduate and high school researchers from local communities and underrepresented groups in STEM in project activities, and to reach out to local prison populations through an annual lecture series focused on the effects of variation in environmental conditions and terrestrial ecosystem health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002912.xml,New Strategy for Synthesis of Atomically-Precise Graphene Nanoribbons,NSF,2020-08-01,2023-07-31,420000,"With this award, the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry is supporting Professor Guangbin Dong at the University of Chicago to develop new approaches for preparing atomically-precise, water-soluble graphene nanoribbons.  These nanoribbons are strips (50-100 thousand times thinner than a human hair) of graphene: a sheet of carbon atoms arranged in a rigid structure that resembles chicken wire. Graphene nanoribbons come in two different structural forms, armchair and zigzag.  Armchair graphene nanoribbons have emerged as attractive organic materials for potential applications in high-speed, light-weight and flexible electronic devices.  Zigzag graphene nanoribbons represent promising materials for developing efficient spintronic (spin-electronic) devices.  To date, the efficient and practical synthesis of water-soluble and processable graphene has not been possible.  The Dong group is combining physical organic chemistry knowledge with advanced tools of transition-metal catalysis to overcome the synthetic challenges and the processability problem.  The development of scalable synthetic approaches for the production of pure forms of armchair and zigzag nanoribbons opens the way for novel applications of these materials in nanoelectronics, spintronic and quantum computing devices.  During the course of this research, the Dong group is actively participating in the Leadership Alliance Summer Research Program to encourage diverse groups of minority undergraduate students to explore careers in science and engineering.  The Dong group is also actively engaged in the University of Chicago's graduate student “ChiS&E” program providing educational outreach activities to students from local public middle schools.<br/><br/>This research project seeks to offer efficient and scalable synthetic approaches for preparing atomically-precise, water-soluble armchair and zigzag graphene nanoribbons (aGNRs and zGNRs) that could be ultimately used in high performance electronic and spintronic devices. The objectives are to realize solution-phase synthesis of aGNRs and zGNRs with precisely installed piperazine side chains. The key synthetic challenge is to exploit the newly developed palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) catalysis to prepare these unique monomers for GNR synthesis. Compared to the existing approaches of GNR synthesis, the merits of the new strategies include: monomers that are prepared in a streamlined manner from commercially available chemicals; redundant bulky side chains that are avoided for better imaging of the material edge structures; and products that are expected to exhibit high solubility and processability in aqueous solutions. The successful implementation of the research may address two long-standing challenges: synthesis of water-soluble GNRs and solution-phase preparation of zGNRs, which are critical factors for solution processability of these materials and the development of graphene-based spintronic devices. The research facilitates the physical and theoretical studies of these intriguing materials, as many of those aGNRs and zGNRs may be made for the first time in the lab and then used to validate or examine various theoretical models and hypotheses proposed previously by physicists and physical chemists. The knowledge obtained from these investigations may improve our understanding of these graphene-like one-dimensional polymers.  This, in turn, may further inspire and stimulate the development of other new conjugated organic semiconducting materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Tsunamis generated at this subduction zone may also impact the U.S. East Coast. This project supports land and sea seismic experiments across the PRT and Puerto Rico. The experiments will define the detailed seismic structure of the PRT, advance our understanding of the PRT, and improve hazard assessment. The project consists of: (1) Three wide-angle seismic reflection/refraction profiles using ocean bottom seismometers (OBS); (2) Four multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection profiles, two parallel to and inland from the trench, and two parallel to the central OBS profile. (3) An array of more than 100 short-period land seismometers deployed across the Puerto Rico island, together with a dozen broad-band seismometers to record earthquakes for 18 months. The project will provide support for training several graduate students and an early career scientist, as well as research opportunities for faculty and students at a minority serving institution. The project will also support training of science journalists and public lectures to reach Puerto Rico residents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports an active-source seismic experiment across the Puerto Rico Trench (PRT), its outer rise, and across the island arc, together with a land passive-source experiment. The PRT is a highly oblique subduction zone, where old Atlantic plate subducts under the Caribbean plate at a slow rate. The PRT is associated with anomalous and unexplained characteristics, such as the widest trench (below 6,000 m), the lowest gravity anomaly on Earth, and anomalous subsidence of the north coast of Puerto Rico. This project will acquire, analyze, and interpret multiple types of data: Three wide-angle seismic reflection/refraction profiles across the PRT with OBSs and an additional line south of the Puerto Rico island; four MCS reflection profiles, two each parallel and perpendicular to the PRT axis; an array of active- and passive-source land seismic stations on the Puerto Rico island; and multibeam bathymetry, 3.5 kHz sub-bottom profiler, gravity, and magnetics. The experiments are designed to address three key questions: (1) What is the shallow geometry of the subducting slab and its lateral continuity along the 500-km section of the trench? (2) What are the degree and spatial extent of hydration of the Atlantic lithosphere entering the Puerto Rico Trench? (3) Does oceanic bivergent thrust system represent double-sided subduction or a crustal retro-wedge of one-sided subduction? Results of the integrated seismic experiments are expected to significantly advance our understanding of the above scientific questions and assessment of the PRT seismic and tsunami hazard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their evolution stretches 300 Mya and there are ~6200 known species found in nearly all parts of the world. They are central to understanding the evolution of flight, as their ancestors were among the first animals to fly. While flight evolved early, they are remarkable aerial ambush predators serving a key ecological role in communities as predators on other insects such as biting flies (e.g., mosquitoes). Odonates are also one of a few animal groups that spend part of their life in freshwater and another part on land, and so they are key indicators of healthy freshwater systems. They have received much scientific interest, but information about their genealogy, ecology, and distribution is not centralized in any one source. This research is important because it will gather this information for nearly all species and put it in an online database that is available to both the public and researchers. This will be the first such database for an entire order of insect. It will allow dragonflies and damselflies to be used more in environmental, ecological, and evolutionary studies. The research will also help educate the public in dragonfly, and more broadly insect, evolution, ecology and conservation. <br/><br/>The aims of this research are two-fold. It will amass phylogenetic, ecological and geospatial data, making this available for the wider scientific community via the OdonataCentral website. Secondly, this data will be used to study the historical impact of mobility, habitat, niche, color, and distribution on odonate diversification and diversity patterns at the global level. The project will bring together leaders in Odonata phylogenetics, ecology, biogeography as well as informatics and citizen science, and will: (1) develop a robust, species-level molecular and morphological phylogeny of extant and fossil Odonata; (2) amass ecological traits, especially rich information about dragon- and damselfly color, and develop full global distribution and environmental niche information; (3) test evolutionary hypotheses regarding diversification of Odonata, especially the role of color evolution; (4) develop visualizations, knowledge products and analyses that dynamically integrate these three data layers while engaging the general public through museum, web- and mobile-app based tools and outreach. Odonates are dependent on freshwater, a habitat type that is broadly underserved by currently funded research but that is crucial for human well-being.

This event is accompanied by an abrupt 5 to 9 degrees Celsius (9 to 16 degrees Fahrenheit) global temperature rise along with indications of large quantities of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. This project will refine the stratigraphic record of this event as preserved in deposits of the ancient Tethys sea for proxy records of temperature change during this interval in this region. The research will use nannofossil biochronology and high-resolution magnetic susceptibility to begin to unravel the geological history of the region and examine the potential to use a state-of-the art geochemical paleothermometer to quantify temperature change.  In doing so, the research will evaluate the importance of the Tethys sea in global climate patterns as well as the role of rapid changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide in this much warmer climate state. The project will also provide support for undergraduate students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Students will be recruited from the American Chemical Society’s project SEED (Summer Experiences for the Economically Disadvantaged) and GS-LSAMP (the Garden State Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation).  The results of the research will be presented in public events and the data made available to the broader paleoclimate community through the NOAA Paleoclimate database and MagIC database.<br/><br/>Specifically, the research goals of this project are to (1) further develop the stratigraphic record of the pace and timing of temperature increase in the eastern Tethys sea during the PETM , (2) use rock magnetic cyclostratigraphy to estimate the sedimentation rate, and (3) evaluate the feasibility of applying the distributions of glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers to reconstruct sea surface temperatures. These data will evaluate the potential importance of the eastern Tethys in regulating global temperature and moisture changes, as well as the role of large and rapid changes in atmospheric CO2 forcing during the PETM. This information could help document a paleoclimate record that will transform our understanding of the drivers of the PETM and offer useful insight into how the Earth system will respond to current increases in atmospheric CO2 and more generally provide insight into key parameters in global climate models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Varieties can vary by changing the coefficients of polynomials, and it is an important question on when their geometric shapes will remain in a nice way. When the varieties are positively curved called Fano varieties, a natural approach is to look at those with Einstein structures, a notion originated from general relativity. The Einstein structures are deeply related to K-stability, a stability theory in algebraic geometry. The PI will study Fano varieties with Einstein structures, and how they degenerate and develop singularities. The problems are foundational and have deep connections among different areas of mathematics, such as algebraic geometry, differential geometry, commutative algebra, and mathematical physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will investigate K-stability of Fano varieties, their moduli spaces, and geometry of singularities.

Atmospheric Cl emitted from wintertime saline snowpacks can react with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from the oil fields to form secondary organic aerosol (SOA). The importance of this process will be evaluated and the results may have application to other coastal, snow-covered, polluted locations around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will test the hypothesis that chlorine chemistry occurring in the vicinity of wintertime oil fields with saline snowpacks can result in the oxidation of VOCs emitted from oil field activities and the formation of oxidized VOCs (OVOCs) and SOA.

These predictions rely on models of ice-sheet flow that in turn rely on knowledge of the physical conditions of the Antarctic continent beneath the ice.  Exploration of Antarctica by land, sea, and air has advanced our understanding of the geological material under the Antarctic ice sheet, but this information has not yet been fully integrated into ice-sheet models.  This project will take advantage of existing data from decades of US and international investment in geophysical surveys to create a new understanding of the geology underlying the Amundsen Sea and the adjacent areas of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet—a portion of Antarctica that is considered particularly vulnerable to collapse.   A series of new datasets called “Bed Classes” will be developed that will translate the geological properties of the Antarctic continent in ways that can be incorporated into ice-sheet models.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a new regional geologic/tectonic framework for the Amundsen Sea Embayment and its ice catchments using extensive marine and airborne geophysical data together with ground-based onshore geophysical and geological constraints to delineate sedimentary basins, bedrock ridges, faults, and volcanic structures. Using this new geologic interpretation of the region, several key issues regarding the geologic influence on ice-sheet stability will be addressed: whether the regional heat flow is dominated by localization along the faults or lithology; the role of geology on the sources, sinks, and flow-paths of subglacial water; the distribution of sediments that determine bed-character variability; and the extent of geologic control on the current Thwaites Glacier grounding line. The impact of improved geological knowledge on ice-sheet models will be tested with the development of a set of “Bed Class” grids to capture these new insights for use in the models.  Bed Classes will be tested within the Parallel Ice Sheet Model framework with initial experiments to identify the sensitivity of model simulations to geological parameterizations.  Through a series of workshops with ice-sheet modelers, the Bed Classes will be refined and made accessible to the broader modelling community.  This work aims to ensure that the Bed-Class concept can be applied more broadly to ice-sheet models working in different geographic areas and on different timescales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2001954.xml,Doctoral Dissertation Research: Latinidad in Precision Medicine: Emergence of Imagined Genetic Communities,NSF,2020-05-01,2023-04-30,15970,"Precision medicine efforts aim to tailor healthcare to individuals by devising the most effective treatments based on genetic profiles.  But how are these efforts implemented within genetically diverse populations who nonetheless share perceived common ethnicities?  This project investigates these issues within the context of the Latinx population, which is very diverse genetically, but is one that the medical community often mischaracterizes as they provide research reports, recruit medical study participants and devise public educational materials.  The project analyzes how precision medicine investigators think about and act upon attributes of the Latinx population as a target community.  It will analyze the approaches, logics, and frameworks used to make sense of group identity.  It will also investigate how these factors may contribute to racialized concepts of human difference among and within populations.  More broadly, the project considers how the concepts of biology and race might affect broader political understandings and processes pertaining to Latinx people, and thus provides input to policy makers in medical communities and beyond as they strive to acknowledge and support racial diversity in the United States.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We know that racialized concepts of human, and therefore genomic, differences persist in biomedicine, yet the relevance of race and ethnicity in genomics is contested. Focusing on Latinx populations for precision medicine presents a paradox because the Latinx label is a broad one that nonetheless contains strong diversity in genetic profiles. The first study phase will be a content analysis of 100 precision medicine texts, such as research reports, public education materials, and participant recruitment materials, which reflect racial and ethnic identities of participants, data, or bio-specimens.  The second study phase will include ethnographic observations at 15-20 precision medicine events as well as in-depth key-informant interviews with a target of 40 precision medicine investigators.  Finally, the project will conduct semi-structured interviews with 60 Latinx community members relating to genomics, precision medicine and Latinx identity.  Through examination of investigator and research participant perspectives, this study will address how social categorizations are constructed in biomedicine and in contemporary life more broadly. Findings from the project will provide insight into sociological theories regarding how social categorizations are engaged, reinforced, and/or constructed in biomedicine; it will also inform sociological theories of racial identity and medical practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002816.xml,I-Corps: Beacon-Enabled Smart Location-Based Service,NSF,2019-10-01,2022-01-31,30524,"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in enabling new location-based services by using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons in several important market verticals such as public transportation, retail, and events management, to name just a few.  BLE beacon-based software solutions can provide low-cost location-based services in both indoor and outdoor locations, supporting, for example, automatic foot traffic counts and location-based product promotions. As an emerging Internet of Things (IoT) technology, BLE beacons have the potential to become the leading proximity technology. However, the pros and cons of using these technologies in different settings are still not fully understood. For instance, privacy issues regarding location sharing in public spaces can impede the adoption of these technologies. This I-Corps project will explore implementation and commercialization opportunities of beacon-based technologies in airports, business conferences, and retail stores. The success of this project can help promote the adoption of this IoT technology and result in improved efficiency in public services and enhanced quality of people's daily lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will identify the commercial potential for using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacon technology to provide new and low-cost location-based services. A BLE beacon actively broadcasts Bluetooth signals, which can be received by nearby Bluetooth-enabled smartphones. Thus, mobile applications can leverage the beacons that are installed at different locations to detect people's movements, for instance, sensing when people enter or exit certain locations, and estimating the number of people co-located at certain locations. Effective beacon-based solutions need to address the following: ensure accurate movement detection when different beacons' Bluetooth signals interfere with each other; provide a scalable service where a large number of beacons can be supported by different mobile platforms; and include privacy-preserving features to address people's privacy concerns. This project will lead to a better understanding of varying requirements for beacon-based location services and how they might be customized to potentially service a variety of market verticals."

Previous work at Combatant Col demonstrates preservation of annual stratigraphy, water-isotope and geochemical records reflecting important climate and environmental variables including atmospheric circulation, snow accumulation, fire activity, and trans-Pacific dust transport. Existing North Pacific ice cores are located exclusively in Alaska and the Yukon. Combatant Col significantly expands the spatial coverage of ice core records, while simultaneously providing a unique record of hydroclimate in southwestern British Columbia. This project will conduct detailed radar surveys and ice-flow modeling to better understand the glaciological setting and to select the optimal site for drilling. A core to bedrock will be retrieved with logistics supported by the Hakai Cryosphere Node at the University of Northern British Columbia. Analysis of the core included in this project consists of water isotope ratios and visual stratigraphy. In combination with high-resolution radar imaging, the core from Combatant Col will be used to determine whether the observed firn-aquifer at this site (liquid water is stored perennially above the firn-ice transition) has been a persistent feature at the site, or whether it has formed recently, and to determine its impact on glacier energy balance and dynamics. The core will be archived and made available for additional analyses by the ice-core research community. <br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts include developing a new record of hydroclimate variability from the Combatant Col ice core which will provide quantitative constraints for modeling processes affecting a wide range of ecosystems and human communities in British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Other potential Broader Impacts include field work training and participation (Ice drilling) for a diverse cohort of graduate students facilitated by the proximity of the field site.

2001186.xml,Exotic Quantum Criticalities in Low Dimensions and Systems with Unusual Quantum Many-Body Thermalization,NSF,2020-09-01,2024-08-31,368515,"NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports theoretical research studying exotic collective behaviors involving many quantum particles.  At absolute zero temperature, such systems can organize into myriad quantum states of matter---quantum phases---depending on details of interactions between particles.  While the most common of such phases and their transformations are well understood, some quantum phase transitions do not fit into conventional paradigms, most notably continuous transitions between phases with mismatched orders as can occur in quantum magnets.  Yet another class of phases---so-called gapless spin liquids with emergent itinerant quasiparticles---are proposed to occur in several antiferromagnetic solids that defy ordering even at zero temperature.  (Here, ""liquid"" refers to randomness in the directions of the electrons' magnetism inside a solid.)  The PI's group will pursue tractable examples of such unusual quantum phase transitions in one and two dimensions and also questions motivated by recent experiments in candidate spin-liquid materials.<br/><br/>A different aspect of collective quantum behavior is evolution in time when a system of many particles is started in a non-equilibrium state with finite energy density above zero temperature.  This has come to the fore as experimentalists are engineering systems with many degrees of freedom that behave quantum-mechanically, in part in an effort to develop quantum technologies.  A fundamental idea to describe such an evolution is that of dynamical thermalization and the closely related eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, which offers a way of understanding why time flows only in one direction.  A notable exception to thermalization---so-called many-body localization---occurs in the presence of a large number of impurities.  A challenging question, also of technological interest, is whether thermalization can be completely or at least very strongly suppressed in the absence of impurities.  The PI's group will continue work on understanding pre-thermalization phenomena and also on so-called quantum many-body scar states that violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis.<br/><br/>Projects under this award will initiate graduate students to research at the frontier of quantum many-particle physics and will teach them a variety of analytical and numerical approaches that will prepare them for future careers in quantum physics and quantum engineering areas.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports theoretical research studying different facets of quantum many-body physics: 1) unconventional quantum phase transitions and critical phases at zero temperature, and 2) unusual thermalization dynamics at non-zero energy density above zero temperature.<br/><br/>1) While by now we have good ``fixed-point'' pictures of myriad gapped phases, both conventional and exotic, we do not have as good an understanding of quantum phase transitions in many cases.  Among these, so-called ``deconfined quantum critical points'' that lie beyond the Landau paradigm have fascinated researchers for more than fifteen years; however, finding truly controlled instances of such critical points has been controversial.  Another challenging open problem is the description of gapless fractionalized phases, which are believed to be critical phases that do not require fine-tuning.  The PI's group will search for tractable examples of unconventional quantum critical points in low dimensions and will also pursue projects motivated by recent experiments in candidate gapless spin-liquid materials.<br/><br/>2) This award will also pursue research in quantum many-body dynamics and thermalization in closed quantum systems.  For many years, the interest in such questions had been primarily theoretical, as they relate to foundations of statistical mechanics and notions of quantum chaos.  However, modern experiments in engineered quantum systems such as cold atom arrays, trapped ions, dipolar spin impurities, etc., have already achieved well-isolated systems with many quantum degrees of freedom, and are already finding unexpected phenomena opening new exciting directions in the field.  In this context, the PI's group will specifically pursue examples of unusual thermalization in systems without disorder and will explore questions of pre-thermalization and quantum many-body scar states.  The PI's group studies concrete systems to address challenging open questions and combines and develops both analytical and numerical tools to achieve this.<br/><br/>Projects under this award will initiate graduate students to research at the frontier of condensed-matter physics.  The students will learn a variety of analytical and numerical approaches to quantum many-body systems that will prepare them for future careers in quantum physics and quantum engineering areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002627.xml,Distributed Fault Diagnosis for Large-Scale Nonlinear Stochastic Systems,NSF,2019-09-01,2022-05-31,115235,"Certain industrial and commercial processes or systems consist of increasingly large and complex networks with a number of spatially distributed sub-systems that continually exchange information between each other over a band-limited communication network. Such complex large scale systems are vulnerable for faults and a single malfunction in any sub-system component can cause the entire system to fail or malfunction. This project is motivated by a growing need for a solution that will allow reliable real-time monitoring and supervision of such complex systems especially the safety-critical systems in particular. Current fault detection and isolation technology relies on centralized information processing based on collecting data from the sensors from across the entire network. For complex and large scale networks this approach is not practical due to computational complexity and communication bandwidth limitations. The research will use a novel decentralized approach based on advanced mathematical tools to formulate a solution framework that will enable real-time fault detection and isolation in such large networks and will provide resiliency, availability, and dependability. The project outcomes will impact broader societal applications such as cyber-security, multi-robot systems, structural and agricultural monitoring, pollution source localization, and healthcare monitoring. The project not only has an educational plan for graduate students but also a strong outreach program aimed at multidisciplinary groups of undergraduate and under-represented students to engage them in a real-world scientific experience that lies in the intersection of control systems, communications and algorithms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary research objective of this project is to establish an analytical and computational foundation for distributed fault diagnosis algorithms of nonlinear, large-scale stochastic systems. A distributed version of the particle filtering method will serve as the foundation of the derived diagnostic algorithms. The particle filtering technique is a highly suitable estimator for fault diagnosis since it avoids linearity and Gaussian noise assumptions typically found in current state-of-the-art. The target monolithic process is monitored by a network of interconnected diagnostic nodes with local processing and communication capabilities. The diagnostic network infers information of the entire system based on partial observations and local information exchange between neighboring nodes. The methodology conducts simultaneous real-time fault detection and isolation, keeping the computational complexity to a minimum. The project will establish a novel distributed fault detection methodology that takes advantage of the decentralized architecture and computational strength of modern embedded systems such as wireless sensor networks and multi-core processors. The specific tasks include: derivation of a computationally efficient, centralized fault-sensitive filter that eliminates the need for a bank of estimators to conduct fault isolation; establishment of an analytical method for obtaining global inference about the health of the system based on local observations and information exchange, targeting monolithic processes with geographically sparse subcomponents; and formulation of a distributed FD method that subdivides the monitoring task to low-order, possibly interconnected, components targeted to high-dimensional processes that cannot be accommodated by a central configuration. This research combines previously disparate concepts from estimation theory, fault-tolerance and combinatorics to provide a robust and coherent framework for resilient, available and dependable systems."
2002877.xml,A New Design Paradigm in Low Band Gap Conjugated Polymers,NSF,2020-09-01,2024-06-30,450000,"With this award, the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry is funding Professor Seth C. Rasmussen of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at North Dakota State University to advance fundamental understanding of structure-function relationships in conjugated polymers.  Conjugated polymers are long chain, organic molecules. Much like traditional semiconductors such as silicon, these polymers can become conductive when one applies a voltage (such as in transistors) or light (such as in solar cells).  This team creates design strategies for constructing new types of conjugated polymers with potential applications in organic electronics, photovoltaics and organic light-emitting diodes.  In addition to conventional synthetic techniques, computational modelling is used to evaluate potential polymer structures and to predict their electronic properties. The broader activities associated with this research focus on outreach to Native American colleges via the university’s NATURE program.  The team also contributes to the history of polymer science and technology via the documentation and dissemination of new historical publications on the origin and growth of conjugated polymers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is focused on advancing understanding of structure-function relationships in conjugated polymers, in particular the role of donor-acceptor interactions in efforts to produce reduced band gap (Eg=1.5-2.0 eV) and low band gap (Eg&lt;1.5 eV) polymers.  The band gap is a critical parameter of organic semiconducting materials, particularly for their application in electrochromic devices, organic photovoltaics, organic light-emitting diodes, and NIR photodetectors. Of particular focus here is the application of a new design paradigm that pairs conventional acceptor units with thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine building blocks.  These building block act simultaneously as very strong acceptors and very strong donors. The preparation of the conjugated polymers is accomplished using direct arylation polymerizations. Computational techniques aid in experimental design, predicting desired electronic properties.  This new design paradigm is applied to other monomers such as acenaphtho[1,2-b]thieno[3,4-e]pyrazine, dibenzo[f,h]thieno[3,4-b]quinoxaline and thieno[3',4':5,6]pyrazino[2,3-f][1,10]phenanthroline, and some of the materials are tested in devices via established collaborations.  This research addresses the fundamental design principle for conjugated polymers involving two separate acceptors.  The chemistry is transformative with a strong potential to advance fundamental understanding of conjugated polymer design, especially in terms of the design of low band gap, n-type, and ambipolar polymers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000506.xml,Homological Invariants in Low Dimensional Topology,NSF,2019-08-01,2024-06-30,86764,"This National Science Foundation award supports a project in low dimensional topology, an area of mathematics that studies shapes of three- and four-dimensional spaces. Interestingly, the fundamental problem of understanding and classifying shapes of spaces is more difficult in these lower dimensions compared to higher dimensions. In fact, investigating some of the new phenomena that happen in these dimensions require the use of more modern invariants, or in other words, quantities associated to shapes that can distinguish between those with different properties. This subject is also closely related to knot theory, that is focused on studying the shapes of knotted circles in three-dimensional spaces.  Low dimensional topology and knot theory have various implications in physics (quantum theory), cosmology (the shape of the universe), chemistry (molecular knots) and biology (knotting of DNA and DNA-protein interactions). This project aims to study the shapes of three- and four-dimensional spaces and configurations of knotted circles and surfaces in them using an invariant defined by the PI and her collaborator. In another direction, the PI investigates the relationship between different invariants for knotted circles.  The PI plans to organize seminars and conferences and involve undergraduate students in the combinatorial and computational aspects of this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heegaard Floer homology is a collection of algebraic invariants for low dimensional objects (e.g. 3- and 4-manifolds, knots, links, etc.), defined by counting holomorphic disks. In particular, different types of such invariants have been introduced for 3-manifolds with boundary. For example, Eftekhary and the PI defined tangle Floer homology as a generalization of (minus) Heegaard Floer homology. In one direction, this project aims to (1) study embeddings of graphs and homology cobordism group of homology cylinders using tangle Floer homology and (2) introduce invariants for concordances and Seifert surfaces, and get bounds for unknotting number using cobordism maps for tangle Floer homology. In a different direction, the PI intends to (3) give a computationally effective way for detecting handlebodies using bordered Floer homology (different extension of Heegaard Floer invariants for 3-manifolds with boundary defined by Lipshitz-Ozsvath-Thurston) with the hope of providing a new way for detecting homotopically ribbon fibered knots.  This project also proposes to study the properties of an invariant for knots and links, called symplectic sl(n) homology. This invariant is conjecturally equal to sl(n) homology, and the PI plans to (4) investigate spectral sequences for specific involutions in symplectic sl(n) homology and establish a better understanding of this conjecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The atmosphere converts pollutants by processing them into water-soluble products that are removed through precipitation (rain or snow) or by deposition onto Earth’s surface. This chemical conversion of pollution happens through a sunlight-driven (photochemical) process known as oxidation. Most of what is known about these atmospheric processes comes from measurements made at the surface in Arctic coastal environments. The CHACHA team plans to use two instrumented aircraft to conduct airborne measurements around the Chukchi Sea, the Beaufort Sea, and the Alaska North Slope region. They plan to target features that are rapidly changing - above and downwind of sea ice ""leads"" (areas of open water in otherwise sea-ice-covered ocean regions), and downwind of sources of combustion-derived pollutants. Researchers will also use collected data to develop atmospheric models that will be openly available for use by the broader scientific community. The team is composed of researchers at six United States universities (in Alaska, Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and New York) and will mentor a diverse group of students and postdoctoral scholars. Researchers will also engage in several additional education and outreach activities, including an “aircraft open house” and an annual three-day Science Fair in Utqiaġvik, AK. Overall, this project will enable the United States to better understand how rapid change in the Arctic impacts the chemical composition of the atmosphere and to translate what was learned to other regions - including the atmosphere above the world's oceans and in Earth's upper atmosphere. In addition, this project is co-funded by the Arctic Natural Sciences and Atmospheric Chemistry programs.<br/><br/>This project will improve understanding of atmospheric halogen chemistry in the gas, aerosol, and cloud water phases, with a focus on how that chemistry is impacted by Arctic sea ice loss and fossil fuel extraction. The CHACHA team plans to conduct eight weeks of observations during the Arctic spring, when halogen chemistry is most active, using two aircraft: the University of Wyoming King Air and the Purdue University Airborne Laboratory for Atmospheric Research (ALAR). Aircraft will conduct complementary sampling upwind and downwind of leads (sea ice fractures), over snow-covered tundra, and downwind of the North Slope of Alaska oilfields. Sampling will occur at various altitudes from the near-surface through the boundary layer and into the free troposphere. The team will prioritize measurement of various greenhouse gases (including O3, CO2, CH4, H2O), reactive trace gases (including NO2, SO2, N2O5, HO2NO2, bromine- and chlorine-containing gases), aerosol size distributions and composition, cloud residual particle composition, and cloud particle size distributions, as well as atmospheric data. These observations will be interpreted in part using 0-D and 1-D photochemical models and a cloud parcel model, to evaluate and advance understanding of multi-phase reactions and the vertical and horizontal propagation of atmospheric halogen chemistry in the Arctic. This dataset will improve understanding of the impact of the rapidly changing Arctic on halogen chemistry and atmospheric composition, as well as to provide fundamental knowledge of halogen chemistry that can be applied globally through models. The team will mentor students, postdocs, and conduct an array of unique outreach and educational activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002495.xml,CPS: Synergy: Information Flow Analysis for Cyber-Physical System Security,NSF,2019-08-01,2020-08-31,173627,"This project develops a theory of accountability that encompasses both control and computing systems. A unified theory of accountability in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) can be built on a foundation of causal information flow analysis, a well-established set of methods for computer security. Information flow properties model how inputs of a system affect its outputs. Causal information flow notions provide a useful foundation for accountability since they support traceability, that is, not just detection of violations but also responsibility-assignment, which then can be used to adopt corrective measures. The intellectual merit of the proposed project lies in developing a unified foundation for CPS security based on theories of accountability, which build on causal information flow analysis. Broader impacts include the design of resilient and secure CPS, a key to sustaining reliable operation of a wide range of critical infrastructure applications for societal benefit, such as transportation and smart-grid systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is organized into three major thrusts. With regards to attack detection the project develops information flow analyses to support passive and active detection against realistic adversaries. First, a general framework of information flows to recover existing results related to detection in a unified manner is proposed. Second, information flows are used as an analysis tool, with the goal of producing new results on active detection and stealthy attack characterization. The proposed project will employ this framework to formally study a set of general questions about detection. With respect to responsibility assignment and identification, the project seeks to develop theory and methodologies for identifying nodes responsible for an attack by a novel combination of methods from cryptography and control theory. In particular, it will leverage tools from traitor tracing in cryptography to efficiently search for subsets of nodes that contain malicious or faulty entities. It will employ methods from control theory to evaluate if given subsets of nodes are misbehaving or normal and it will investigate control and design policies to directly attribute information flows to distinct entities. The final task seeks to develop corrective measures via resilient system design and control. This task seeks to develop algorithms to support resilient offline (resource allocation) and online (architectures and algorithms that enable resilient online control) design of CPS and analysis tools to evaluate the security of CPS under composition."

Reza Ghiladi and Stefan Franzen from North Carolina State University to investigate iron containing proteins, specifically heme-iron proteins, from marine environments as models for understanding their function in mammalian systems. Heme-iron proteins are found universally throughout nature, and they perform important biological roles that are the foundation for nearly all living systems. Notable examples of heme-iron proteins include the oxygen carrier in blood, hemoglobin, and the detoxifying enzymes known as cytochromes P450 found in the liver. While the importance of heme proteins has been recognized by the chemical and biological communities for many years, it is challenging to apply the latest emerging techniques to study their function.  The use of related but simpler marine hemoglobin provides an avenue to develop these methods while also gaining a better understanding the diverse roles of heme proteins in biology and chemistry. The proposed experimental procedures help characterize at the atomic level how molecules will bind to these important proteins and alter their function. This pursuit allows graduate students to acquire specialized training in both high resolution X-ray and neutron crystallography, as well as in time-resolved structural methods. The fast timescale methods are cutting-edge techniques that push the limits of what is experimentally obtainable for studying how enzymes perform their tasks within living systems. This project is integrated with the ""Creating STARS"" outreach program to provide rural middle school science classrooms with visits, demonstrations, lectures, and lessons plans covering the chemistry/life interface. The project is also engaging both domestic (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) and international (University of Essex and the Polish Academy of Science) partners in data acquisition and analysis.<br/><br/>This research project seeks to identify a unique set of structural interactions that occur upon substrate binding to the enzyme dehaloperoxidase, thereby controlling the kinetics and reactivity of the heme intermediates, and ultimately a discrimination in enzymatic activity specific to the bound substrate. Rapid-freeze-quench, caged O2-carrier photolysis, and CO flash photolysis techniques are to be conducted to enable the trapping of intermediates and to initiate time-resolved studies to characterize in unprecedented detail these mechanistically important intermediates relevant to catalytic turnover. The relationship of dehaloperoxidase to other hemoglobins, peroxidases and peroxygenases establishes new paradigms of protein structure-function relationships relevant to multifunctional proteins, complementing those established for monofunctional enzymes. Information from this study has the potential to advance the understanding of catalytic globins, determine the structural features that lead to activity differentiation across heme proteins (and across metalloenzymes more generally), and enable the comparison of the structure-function correlation in enzymes of marine origin in relation to those from terrestrial or bacterial sources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2002515.xml,Seasonality of Abrupt Climate Change over Greenland: Direct Tests for the Younger Dryas and 8.2 ka event using Paleolimnology,NSF,2020-09-01,2024-08-31,640580,"The Younger Dryas (YD) is the best documented example of abrupt climate change in Earth’s history, yet fundamental traits of the YD remain enigmatic. Greenland sat at the epicenter of YD climate change, with intense cooling registered in ice cores, but nevertheless the Greenland Ice Sheet retreated during the YD. An influential hypothesis suggests that North Atlantic abrupt climate changes were characterized by extreme seasonality, with mild summers that explain counterintuitive YD glacier retreat. Resolving seasonality is crucial to understanding the impacts of past and future climate change on all aspects of the Arctic system – including the ice sheet, because summer temperatures drive surface melt. This study will directly assess seasonality of the YD on Greenland for the first time by developing quantitative summer and winter temperature reconstructions. This study will also assess seasonality of the major cold snap over Greenland 8,200 years ago. Intriguingly, despite being shorter and smaller in annual magnitude than the YD, that event drove glacier advances around Greenland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will clarify how abrupt climate change affects the Arctic/subarctic North Atlantic region, especially Greenland and its ice sheet. By resolving seasonality of air temperatures during the YD, when the ice sheet retreated despite evidence for extremely cold (annual) air temperatures, this study will also clarify the competing roles of precipitation and ocean temperatures in driving past ice sheet behavior – with implications for projections of future ice sheet mass loss. This study will test whether the Holocene 8.2 ka event was essentially a mini YD, or fundamentally different. The latter could make the YD a poor analog for future abrupt climate change, which would unfold in an interglacial world. The 8.2 ka event has been described as an ideal target for testing climate models, but the quantitative reconstructions of associated terrestrial climate changes needed to optimize such tests are rare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another major contribution of this work is calibration and advancement of season-specific methods for reconstructing arctic climate. Such methods are needed to address questions about seasonality on diverse Quaternary timescales, providing essential tests for climate models. The proposed work will also enable more sophisticated interpretations of stable isotope records and paleotemperature reconstructions from the Greenland ice cores by providing direct comparisons. This may yield new insights from those iconic records, once seasonality of the climate changes they capture is clarified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will utilize classic sites that preserve rare, readily dateable YD lake sediment records. Multiple calibrated, season-specific proxies in sediment cores – including insect and pollen assemblages, terrestrial leaf wax δ2H, and aquatic insect δ18O – will test and complement one another and provide new comparisons to annually integrated records from ice cores. This work will build upon the research team’s experience calibrating and applying these proxies in Greenland. A new calibration study will verify the seasonality of leaf wax δ2H in a range of Greenland climates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The possibility of future abrupt climate change is a major societal concern. As evidence accumulates for recent and ongoing changes in North Atlantic Ocean circulation, past abrupt changes in the subpolar North Atlantic are increasingly relevant to the future. This project will train two Ph.D. students and at least six undergraduates. In addition to conducting research during the academic year, students will participate in mentored summer research institutes to build research and communication skills. To share science beyond academia and hone outreach skills, students will conduct outreach (a) in Greenland near the study site, and (b) in a Chicago area high school serving a diverse population of &gt;3200 students, in partnership with teachers who participated in the PI’s 2018 climate science workshop for high school teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2000625.xml,A Regional Approach to College and Career Readiness Pathways in Career and Technical Education,NSF,2020-07-01,2023-06-30,299993,"This project aims to prepare skilled technical workers for high demand occupations in southwest Missouri, including automotive technology, construction technology, and welding technology.  To achieve this goal, a community college and six regional career and technical education centers will collaborate to increase accessibility to education programs in these skilled technical fields.  This coordination is expected to create a seamless transition for rural students from secondary education to a regional postsecondary institution. The increasing demand for skilled technicians in multiple disciplines has placed pressure on K-12 schools and postsecondary institutions in southwest Missouri to support local workforce education and development. In fact, schools across the nation are struggling to find effective strategies to meet such needs.  One challenge is that many students do not consider skilled technical fields as viable career options. Another challenge is that current career and technical education programs struggle to stay current with changing industry tools and techniques.  The project will tackle these challenges by working toward aligning career and technical education curricula with industry needs and preparing teachers to teach the improved curricula.  To this end, the project will implement best practices in curriculum design and educator development from the Advanced Technological Education community.  It will apply these best practices to create a multi-program, regional model for skilled technical education.  Project activities and outcomes may serve as a model for improving program quality in distributed career and technical education departments in other rural areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is designed to develop high-quality, vertically aligned, career and technical education pathways at a regional level. The project focuses on three occupations that were identified by the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center as high demand: automotive technology; construction technology; and welding technology. The project intends to increase high school students’ awareness of technical careers, enhance student advising, and provide students with seamless pathways from secondary school through college, and into the local workforce. The project has the potential to impact hundreds of students in 41 rural Missouri school districts as they transition to post-secondary education. The project has four goals: 1) provide career and technical education teachers at the secondary and postsecondary level with high quality professional development and resources to implement professional learning communities for three technical programs; 2) use Business and Industry Leadership Teams to guide the development of industry-driven curricula in the three programs so that students at the secondary level have opportunities to earn dual credit and stackable credentials; 3) improve student and parent perceptions about the value of these three technical programs through the development of outreach activities and educational materials; and 4) place students in work-based learning opportunities and track their experiences via an online learning management system. Materials developed as a result of this project will be packaged as stand-alone resources and disseminated broadly. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001484.xml,W-Algebras and Universal Objects in Vertex Algebra Theory,NSF,2020-09-01,2024-08-31,165802,"Many structures and concepts that were inspired by physics have had a profound influence on mathematics during the last half century. For example, stringy invariants of manifolds such as quantum cohomology have led to spectacular advances in enumerative geometry. On the algebraic side, a fundamental new structure called a vertex operator algebra (VOA) emerged from quantum field theory in the 1980s, and was axiomatized by Borcherds in his work on the Moonshine Conjecture. VOAs are natural generalizations of commutative rings, and in the last thirty years, they have found applications in a diverse range of subjects including finite group theory, representation theory, combinatorics, number theory, and algebraic geometry. In this project, the PI will investigate the structure and representation theory of VOAs, as well as some connections between VOAs and algebraic geometry. These projects will advance the subject and provide educational and collaborative opportunities for the PI's current and former graduate students.<br/><br/>First, the PI's work on the coset realization of principal W-algebras of A, D, and E types resolved a 30-year-old conjecture which had been a key starting assumption in physics. It has many striking corollaries such as the unitarity of all discrete series representations of principal W-algebras, and the existence of modular tensor categories of modules for affine VOAs at admissible levels. The PI will construct coset realizations of principal W-algebras of other Lie types, as well as non-principal W-algebras and W-superalgebras. Second, the PI recently constructed a universal two-parameter VOA which interpolates between all the type A principal W-algebras, in the sense that they arise as one-parameter quotients of this structure. The PI will construct more general universal objects, which are VOAs defined over the ring of functions on some variety X. Typically, interesting VOAs are obtained by specializing the universal object along certain subvarieties of X, and unexpected isomorphisms of these VOAs correspond to intersection points on these subvarieties. Third, the PI will study two affine schemes that have been attached to a VOA by Arakawa: the associated scheme and the singular support. There is always a closed embedding of the singular support in the arc space of the associated scheme. The PI will investigate good criteria for this embedding to be an isomorphism. This has many applications in VOA theory and is connected to questions about the geometry of arc spaces that are of independent interest.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000200.xml,Quantitative Stochastic Homogenization and Renormalization Methods,NSF,2020-07-01,2024-06-30,340000,"This research project is focused on the development of new mathematical ideas and tools for understanding the macroscopic properties of physical systems with many small-scale irregularities. Composite materials, for example, are manufactured by intermingling two or more constituent materials and often have very different physical properties (heat or electrical conduction, for example) from the individual components. Surprisingly, the properties of the composite material are typically not a simple average of those of its components--it matters greatly how the (microscopic) intermingling is arranged. We want to understand precisely how the large number of microscopic interactions give rise to the macroscopic behavior of such systems, to be able to predict the macroscopic properties of the system by carefully looking at the microscopic arrangement of a sample, and to know exactly how large such a sample must be before our predictions are accurate. We proceed by developing and analyzing idealized mathematical models that display the key features and complexity of real physical systems, but still simple enough that they can be studied mathematically. Very often, our models are partial differential equations with stochastic coefficients--that is, the underlying microscopic behavior of the system is assumed to be random--and the goal is to understand the statistics of the system. Our objective is to develop mathematical approaches that are (i) informed by the physics of the systems, (ii) robust--they can help us solve a variety of other, similar problems arising in, for example, statistical physics and probability theory, and (iii) quantitative--they lead to quantitative estimates of the uncertainty and insight into the development of numerical algorithms for simulation and prediction. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obtaining an ""averaged"" partial differential equation that describes the large-scale behavior of an underlying highly heterogeneous equation with many degrees of freedom (for instance, one with random coefficients) is referred to as ""homogenization"" in the mathematical literature. The homogenized equation is typically much simpler than the ""true"" heterogeneous one, and hence easier to work with. It is therefore important to understand precisely how well the homogenized equation approximates the true equation, and this is the goal of homogenization theory. Mathematicians have recently developed a complete quantitative theory of stochastic homogenization for elliptic equations, and this theory has already been shown to have some surprising and important applications to probability theory and statistical mechanics. The present project aims to continue in this direction, by applying and developing homogenization techniques for gradient lattice models and related models in statistical physics, to the study of hypoelliptic diffusions arising in kinetic theory (modeling gases and plasmas) and toward understanding the behavior of diffusions forced by random vector fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001182.xml,"Period Domains, Motives, and Ramification Theory in Arithmetic Geometry",NSF,2020-07-01,2024-06-30,414000,"This award supports the principal investigators' research in arithmetic geometry. At its heart, arithmetic geometry is concerned with integer (or rational) solutions of polynomial equations, seeking to better understand numbers through their geometric structure. Famous questions in arithmetic geometry include the celebrated Fermat's Last Theorem. In particular, the PIs will study branching behavior (called ""ramification"")  of these geometric objects, and they will investigate parameter spaces that describe them (called ""period domains""). New technology developed by the PIs and others -- including upper ramiﬁcation groups of an arbitrary henselian valuation ring, heights of motives, and motive versions of the Manin conjecture and the Vojta conjecture -- should allow for major progress on open questions in these areas. The project also provides support for the PIs to write books for researchers working in similar areas and provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The principal investigator intends to strengthen his study of ramification theory of schemes and of ell-adic sheaves, various extended period domains, and motives over number fields in arithmetic geometry connecting these subjects, and to study related problems (heights of motives, heights of variation of Hodge structures, Hodge theoretic Nevanlinna theory, zeta functions, Tamagawa number conjecture, Iwasawa theory, Sharifi conjecture, asymptotic behaviors of Beilinson regulators and period integrals which appear in physics etc.). The PI defined heights of motives, and formulated motive versions of the Manin conjecture and the Vojta conjecture about heights of points of an algebraic variety. He intends to obtain non-trivial results on these motive versions. The PI started the Hodge theoretic Nevanliina theory. He plans to make new progress in Hodge theory basing on this Nevanlinna point of view. The PI will collaborate with the co-principal investigator T. Fukaya to study Sharifi conjectures and to study the arithmetic of non-commutative rings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000136.xml,Excellence in Research: Optimizing Quantum Circuits for Fast Cryptanalyzing Pre-Quantum Encryptions and Securing Post-Quantum Cryptographies,NSF,2020-05-01,2024-04-30,439852,"This project promotes the progress of science in quantum computing algorithms and cryptologic techniques in order to improve security of encrypted information, which will have national security and defense applications. Currently, the commonly used encryption algorithms such as RSA are considered “unbreakable” by modern digital computers due to the complexity of computation that would be required. However, this may change in the next decade or so in light of advances in quantum science. Quantum mechanics has led to the discovery that considerable numbers of states can be manipulated at the same time thus significantly reduce the amount of time in processing. New quantum computers have shown the baseline of “quantum supremacy” in solving problems that classical digital computers practically cannot. Efficient quantum algorithms are key to enable computer scientists to take full advantage of the next generation of practical quantum computers to efficiently solve today’s unsolvable problems. Advances in quantum science in both breaking and securing the encryptions are paramount for national security and preventing adversaries from taking advantage of critical areas of national defense. This project seeks to discover efficient quantum cryptologic methods (i.e. the art of revealing the secret) and secure quantum cryptographic techniques (i.e. the science of making the secret more secure). This project not only exhibits the excellence in scientific research, but also supports diversity and inclusion goals for the benefit of society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum cryptoanalysis plays an important role in finding vulnerabilities of existing crypto systems. It can also become an effective tool in fighting adversaries in cyber operations. Efficient quantum algorithms are indispensable to the utilization of quantum computer resources to solve today’s unsolvable problems.  It has the potential to break the current crypto systems such as RSA with the advances of next-generation quantum computers. Currently, most quantum cryptanalytic algorithms have limited capability to factor multiple integers due to the fact that each Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), the speed machine to find out a period of a particular integer, requires a unique quantum circuit. According to Shor’s algorithm, once the period is found, finding factors (crypto keys) becomes easy. To break the RSA encryption, one needs to design a unique quantum circuit for each integer being exploited. Since there are a large number of integers to exploit, the current one integer-one circuit factor finding approach is not practically useful. This project aims to discover techniques to automatically generate quantum circuits and factor multiple integers at once. The research also explores how artificial intelligence can assist in designing efficient quantum algorithms and test those algorithms using quantum simulators and on real quantum computers. Computational-wise, the project speeds up the cryptanalytic process by improving the order of approximation significantly on top of a polynomial degree that the QFT has saved from the unsolvable exponential degree. The findings from this research will have significant impact on both quantum cryptology and quantum cryptography. This research seeks to transform cryptanalytic study from theoretical to practical, and improve the integrity of the next-generation Quantum Internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this research is the development of catalytic chemical reactions using the earth-abundant and inexpensive copper (Cu) as the catalyst. The target reactions provide powerful tools for the syntheses of complex and diversified molecules, such as drugs and organic materials, by limiting the required number of reaction steps and thus minimizing the time for process development. The outcomes of this investigation have a positive impact on society by developing novel protocols for organic chemical transformations based on earth-abundant, sustainable catalysts. Professor Giri has established a partnership with the UNM College Enrichment and Outreach Program to involve undergraduates from traditionally underrepresented groups.  He has established an outreach program with the South Valley Academy, a public charter school in Benalillo County, New Mexico. <br/><br/>Integration of cross-coupling into the tandem and multi-component (MC) reaction manifolds has the potential to create new synthetic methodologies. The research focuses on developing Cu compounds as sustainable catalysts for the proposed transformations. As part of the education component, the investigator has developed a course for senior undergraduates and graduate students focused on organometallic chemistry that emphasizes the use of sustainable transition metals in the development of new chemical transformations. In this project, various organometallic reagents, amines, alcohols, and carbonyl compounds are employed as sources of nucleophiles to add across carbon-carbon multiple bonds (olefins, alkynes, and allenes) and subsequently cross-couple with organohalides in a tandem fashion. The ability of copper to avoid beta-hydride eliminations is expected to facilitate the tandem and MC cross-couplings of electrophiles and nucleophiles that contain beta-hydrogens. Hybrid bidentate ligands containing both pi-acceptor and sigma-donor groups are employed to generate stable and active Cu in the +1 oxidation state required to conduct the proposed transformations. The ligands are tuned sterically and electronically to render Cu reactive towards the less reactive aryl halides. Alternatively, organic electron donor-based organic catalysts, which react with organohalides via a single electron transfer process, provide an alternative strategy for coupling reactions with less reactive aryl halides. A long-term goal of the project is to perform the reactions enantioselectively using chiral, non-racemic ligands to prepare complex molecules with multiple chiral centers.The research is performed at the interface of organic, inorganic and organometallic chemistry, which provides an opportunity for training future scientists from high school to graduate school. This award also supports the outreach efforts of the Giri group to train high school and undergraduate students from traditionally underrepresented groups in the sciences."

This STTR project will develop human matrix metalloprotease (MMPs), a class of enzymes that degrade many biomolecules including collagen, the most abundant structural protein in the human body. MMPs are critical for numerous normal and pathological processes, such as tumor growth. However, MMPs are expensive to produce, and researchers need a reliable source of well-characterized human MMPs so that researchers can pursue high quality, reliable experiments on basic science and medical applications. Furthermore, this project can impact other fields that use enzymes, such as the food industry, renewable energy, and human health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will commercialize inexpensive recombinant human MMPs produced in E. coli. MMPs degrade and regulate various structural components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), impacting pathologies such as metastasis of solid tumors, which cannot occur without MMP-mediated degradation of collagens. Recombinant MMPs can support this research.  This STTR project will advance development of protease-based protein purification without chromatography, enabling rapid and low-cost purification. The technical R&amp;D tasks include developing technical assessments for MMPs. The technical assessments will contain raw and curated data for purity, identity, concentration, and activity of MMPs at different solution conditions. This project will investigate development of MMPs as anti-biofilm and anti-clot agents beyond the traditional collagen degradation field of research.

(2) How do families manage the experience of indebtedness and repayment together?  Data collection will be through two interviews 12 months apart with recent students, a monthly diary survey over the course of the year for these recent students, and an interview with their parents.

Wildfire is a key component of summer climate in the North Pacific where wildfires are projected to increase with continued summer warming. Studies that combine paleorecords of summer climate and wildfire are therefore critically needed, especially in the North Pacific region where fire recurrence rate and decadal-to-centennial scale climate fluctuations occur over longer time periods than are covered by direct observations. The goal of the proposed research is to improve our understanding of relationships between summertime climate and wildfire activity, focusing especially on the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), when regional temperatures were perhaps as warm as the 20th century. Recent advances now permit the measurement of new fire-related (pyrogenic) compounds in ice cores, enabling the development of a robust fire record capable of rigorous comparison with regional paleoclimate reconstructions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The records of summer atmospheric circulation developed through this project will be regionally unique and fill a critical gap in the suite of North Pacific paleoclimate records. The ice core fire records will have synchronously dated temperature, precipitation and circulation time series. Our unique compilation of these ice core records, as well as other regional paleoproxy records will be the first effort at combining these datasets into a regional compilation of paleofire records in the North Pacific region. This compilation will facilitate the examination of fire activity during Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) conditions that are of comparable magnitude to present climate changes over socially relevant timescales (decades). We will analyze the archive Denali ice core for black carbon, which is derived from both biomass and fossil fuel combustion, and organic aromatic acids (e.g. vanillic acid) and monosaccharide anhydride (e.g. levoglucosan) which are produced solely from biomass burning. The Denali ice core chronology is already developed, and the archive ice is in hand, ensuring that our research plan can be accomplished. Fire record synthesis and calibration will incorporate instrumental fire databases, gridded burn area data, and HYSPLIT back-trajectory analyses over the instrumental era in order to test the sensitivity of fireclimate relationships over time. With this record we will address the following research questions: (1) How have North Pacific summer atmospheric circulation patterns varied over the last 1500 years? (2) How did North Pacific fire regime characteristics naturally respond to the warm summer conditions of the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA)? (3) Are there consistent relationships between North Pacific fire regime and climate?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A focal point of our broader impacts is support for two young investigators who have specialized expertise in North Pacific ice cores and paleofire modeling, respectively. This project will also support one PhD student and several undergraduate students. We will continue our longstanding collaboration with Denali National Park to present and permanently display our major climate- and fire-related findings at the park visitor center in Talkeetna, Alaska. We are partnering with the Natural Sciences Education and Outreach Center at Colorado State University to develop STEM kits focused on the Denali ice core record for distribution to under-served K-12 students in Alaska and Maine. Prototypes of these kits have already been developed and tested with students, and we propose to significantly expand this program and increase its impact. Other activities include the participation of first-year women researchers in this project as part of the Dartmouth Women In Science Project (WISP) initiative, and through participation in the NSF-supported School of Ice, where faculty from historically black colleges and minority-serving institutions learn about ice cores and climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For this research, paleontologists will study fossil vertebrates that span from about 260?240 million years ago to understand how life evolved at high latitudes in the face of massive climate change.  In addition, geologists will use fossil soils and fossil plant matter to more precisely understand the climate of Antarctica across this extinction boundary.  These data will allow for a more complete understanding of ancient climates and how Antarctic life compared to that at lower latitudes.  Undergraduate and graduate students will be actively involved in this research.  Public engagement in Antarctic science will be accomplished at several natural history museums.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year project will examine the evolution of Permo-Triassic paleoenvironments and their vertebrate communities by conducting fieldwork in the Shackleton Glacier region of Antarctica.  The team will characterize the Permo-Triassic boundary within Shackleton area strata and correlate it to other stratigraphic successions in the region (e.g. via stable carbon isotope stratigraphy of fossilized plant organic matter).  The researchers will use multiple types of data to assess the paleoenvironment, including: 1) paleosol morphology; 2) paleosol geochemistry; 3) pedogenic organic matter; and 4) fossil wood chronology and stable isotopes.  The Fremouw Formation of Antarctica preserves the highest paleolatitude (~70° S) tetrapod fauna of the entire Triassic and thus has the potential to shed important light on the evolution of polar life during the early Mesozoic.  The biology of Triassic vertebrates from Antarctica will be compared to conspecifics from lower paleolatitudes through analysis of growth in bone and tusk histology.  An interdisciplinary approach will be used to address relationships between environmental change, faunal composition, and biogeographic patterns in the context of the high-latitude strata preserved in the Buckley and Fremouw formations in the Shackleton Glacier region."
2002352.xml,NSFGEO-NERC: Adjoint tomography of mantle viscosity using deglacial sea level observations,NSF,2020-06-15,2023-05-31,408003,"Future sea level change in response to ongoing warming is of societal concern. Adapting to rising seas is a pressing challenge for public health, coastal infrastructure, and economic stability. Sea level today and in the past changes due to the addition of meltwater to the ocean basins, but also due to uplift or sinking of coastlines. One reason for the warping of Earth’s surface is that major ice sheets during the last glacial maximum have pressed down on Earth’s surface and released it as they melt. The investigators will use computational modeling to simulate how sea level and the solid Earth change in response to changing ice sheets over the past 25,000 years when Earth transitioned out of a glacial maximum. To calibrate their model, the team compares their predictions to more than 13,000 sea level observations from the geologic record. That allows them to improve the model and in particular better understand Earth’s internal viscosity, which is a key parameter in these sea level models. This work will allow the team to answer fundamental questions about how fast or slowly Earth’s interior deforms, but also how much solid Earth deformation contributes to sea level change along coastlines today. This is particularly relevant for cities along the U.S. East and West coast in which solid Earth deformation contributes a similar amount of sea level rise compared to warming oceans and melting ice sheets.  This project will train two postdoctoral research scientists and one graduate student in an international and highly interdisciplinary setting to understand Earth's internal structure, its climatic history and the pace and magnitude of global change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The viscosity of Earth's mantle varies radially and laterally as a result of its complex thermal structure.  While it is known from seismology, geodynamics, mineral physics, and sea level observations that these variations exist, they are difficult to constrain. Through glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) -- the viscoelastic response of the Earth to waxing and waning ice sheets -- this incomplete knowledge propagates into questions of past ice sheets and sea level change. This proposal constitutes an effort to better understand Earth rheology and its implications for cryosphere evolution. The novel aspect proposed here is to invert sea level, geodetic, and gravitational observations for rheology and deglacial ice sheet changes using gradient-based optimization. Model gradients will be efficiently calculated using the adjoint method. This framework allows the investigators to move beyond a limited set of forward simulations and enables them for the first time to efficiently assimilate sea level data and other GIA observations into a 3D GIA model. The international team will use a newly compiled dataset with over 13,000 datapoints of deglacial sea level to produce the first tomographic image of Earth's internal viscosity structure. They will furthermore use this approach to produce ice sheet reconstructions that are consistent with 3D Earth models. In addition to exploring trade-offs between the Earth and ice structure, the team will develop and implement second-order adjoint equations to assess uncertainty propagation. The model output will allow the investigators to address two targeted research questions, (1) the amount of melt or re-advance of different ice sheets during the Holocene and (2) the present-day contribution of GIA and its uncertainty to sea level change in major coastal cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a project that is jointly funded by the National Science Foundation’s Directorate of Geosciences (NSF/GEO) and the National  Environment Research Council (UKRI/NERC) of the United Kingdom (UK) via the NSF/GEO-NERC Lead Agency Agreement.

The award to Lincoln University, Missouri, has potential broader impacts in a number of areas. The goal of this project is to study the relationship between dust properties and the interstellar environments.  The project is a collaborative effort with faculty at the University of Missouri-Columbia, involves undergraduate students in the research, and is developing three undergraduate astronomy courses.<br/><br/>While it is well recognized that both the Galactic interstellar extinction curves and the gas-phase abundances of carbon, oxygen, and other metal elements exhibit considerable variations from one sightline to another, as yet, most of the dust extinction modeling efforts have been directed to the Galactic average extinction curve which is obtained by averaging over many clouds of different gas and dust properties. Therefore, any details concerning the relationship between the dust properties and the interstellar environments are lost. By utilizing the wealth of extinction and abundance data obtained by the International Ultraviolet Explorer, Hubble Space Telescope, and the Far-Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer, this project explores the dust properties of over one hundred individual sight lines by simultaneously both fitting the observed extinction curve from the near-infrared to the far-ultraviolet and conforming to the observed abundance constraints. Thus insight into the physical nature of interstellar grains and how they are related to the physical and chemical conditions of their environments will be gained. The results of the research will greatly benefit the analysis and understanding of the previously acquired data from various space missions, as well as of future data obtained.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their collaborative research addresses the complex roles played in the atmosphere by volatile organic molecules that are derived from plants.  These molecules exchange between gases and particles in the atmosphere in ways that are poorly understood.  Atmospheric particles, also known as aerosols, affect many important atmospheric processes, such as cloud formation, and the Earth's climate.  The research team utilizes synthetic organic chemistry to make molecules thought to exist in the atmosphere and uses them in experiments designed to simulate atmospheric conditions. The outcome of this research may be an improved understanding of atmospheric processes, which allows for more accurate modelling of the weather and climate system.

While it is extremely challenging with conventional electronic signal generation technology, mm-wave silicon-photonics technology has the potential to provide mm-wave signal generators with simultaneous ultra-wide bandwidth, ultra-low phase noise, high frequency resolution and small footprint. Utilizing photonics modulators, filters and delay elements along with integrated electronics will allow the use of mm-wave silicon-photonics to fulfill these requirements. This project will demonstrate ultra-low phase noise, ultra-wideband, and high-resolution mm-wave silicon-photonics signal generators to advance wireless technologies for applications such as modern instrumentation, software-defined radios, radars, and warfare systems. The research has the potential to revolutionize the future of instrumentation and wireless industries and provide further technological diversification for the semiconductor industry.  In addition to the aforementioned technical impacts, the project also promotes outreach activities to increase participation of under-represented groups in science and engineering, including annual summer camps for high school students. The research and educational results of this work will be disseminated to academic, industrial and government sectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of this project is to develop novel chip-scale mm-wave silicon-photonics signal generator architectures with ultra-low phase noise, ultra-wideband, continuous tuning range, and high-resolution capabilities implemented using hybrid Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) photonics and Complementary-Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) chips. The emergence of silicon-photonics technology has enabled the potential of realizing silicon-photonics optoelectronic oscillator (OEO) to achieve microwave signal generation within the size and power consumption of small form-factor systems. However, the potential realization of existing silicon-photonics OEOs has two main challenges; first, the tuning range and phase noise are limited due to poor OEO architectural choices and, second, the photonics components’ initial responses are significantly distorted due to the process variation of silicon-photonics technology, so an automatic calibration methodology of these initial responses is missing. CMOS electronics can be employed along with the silicon-photonics OEO to perform phase/frequency locking, laser phase noise reduction, and automatic calibration of silicon-photonics components. Employing electronic control circuitry implemented on CMOS chip allows for the signal generator phase/frequency locking, laser phase noise reduction, and compensation of severe process and temperature variations in silicon-photonics.  The research objectives are:  (1) architecture definition of a mm-wave silicon-photonics signal generator based on an integrated phase/frequency-locked OEO with laser phase noise cancellation along with performance analysis, (2) development of a novel silicon-photonics OEO architecture and its components including modulator, filter and delay element, and algorithms/hardware for their automatic tuning, (3) implementation of novel CMOS prototypes which include the OEO electronic circuitry, laser phase noise reduction, phase/frequency locking loop and automatic tuning hardware, and (4) hybrid integration of silicon-photonics and CMOS chips and perform the required tests for the entire unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite a wealth of literature on competition in psychology, economics and political science, relatively little attention has been paid to the role of competition between such organizations.  One would expect that sustained rivalries between groups can, in turn, lead to more general forms of violence against the population more broadly.  These expectations are counterintuitive given the amount of work - both academic and policy-based - that contends competition among non-state organizations can serve to reduce violence.  Conclusions of this sort have led political actors to adopt policies that might lead them to support one group in the hopes that it will destroy or distract a rival group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses two remaining issues with respect to competitive dynamics among violent non-state actors in the field of international relations.  First, there is currently no large-scale dataset that provides detailed information on the competitive relationships between specific organizations. In this project, the authors develop a typology of rivalry along with a dyadic dataset that captures detailed information about the nature and intensity of intergroup rivalries over time.  Second, existing research overlooks the impact of multiple intergroup relationships on group behavior.  To address this omission, the research team utilizes both dyadic and social network analysis techniques to identify the effect of multiple simultaneous relationships.  This approach also allows them to examine to the ""co-evolution"" of violent behavior and the formation of rivalries."

This influence is evident during El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Interannual ENSO variations in the tropical Pacific drive large shifts in global weather patterns, including regional rainfall extremes that can lead to floods, droughts, and wildfires. Decade-to-decade changes in the tropical Pacific also have large impacts on global climate, including the rate and pattern of global warming. Thus, to predict future changes in global climate and weather extremes we must know about the long-term state of the tropical Pacific and about changes in ENSO variability. However, the impacts of human activities since the start of the Industrial Revolution on conditions in the tropical Pacific are poorly known. This limits our ability to predict climate for the coming decades. Direct climate observations from the central equatorial Pacific are sparse prior to 1950, but this data gap can be filled by records of climate from geologic archives such as corals, tree rings, and ice cores. This project will use precisely dated coral records from the central equatorial Pacific to produce a record of ocean temperature since about 1800. This temperature record will be compared with climate model simulations to understand the observed trends and variability in ocean temperature, and their impact on climate. The project will support research by both graduate and undergraduate students. It will also develop outreach videos aimed at K-12 students and teachers.<br/><br/><br/>The project aims to generate up to 20 new precisely-dated records of monthly-resolved sea-surface temperature and hydrological variability in the central tropical Pacific during the period from 1800-1950CE using paired oxygen isotope and trace element measurements in modern and fossil corals from Kiritimati Island (2N, 157W). The proposed work builds on the success of recent ""ensemble"" approaches to coral-based climate reconstruction that allow for the development of high-fidelity, monthly-resolved records tropical Pacific climate with explicit quantification of uncertainties, grounded in calibration of modern corals against instrumental climate records over recent decades. Moreover, the application of paired coral d18O and Sr/Ca analyses allows for the separate identification of temperature and hydrological trends over the last centuries - filling critical data gaps and allowing for detailed data-model intercomparison with advanced ocean state reanalyses products. The proposed work includes the application of a wide variety of strategies to assess the robustness of the coral-based climate records, including detailed analysis of sample preservation, as geochemical alteration can introduce significant artifacts into coral-based climate reconstructions if it goes undetected. If successful, the proposed work would provide a blueprint for the extension of the short instrumental climate record throughout the Pacific Ocean, utilizing samples from extensive coral rubble fields that are present on many ocean islands.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cars, trucks, motorcycles, airplanes, ships, and submarines all require a lot of fuel to overcome this drag force and move through air or water. A large part of this resistance is caused by friction effects between the surface and the fluid. These effects are confined in a very thin region near the surface, called the boundary layer. The boundary layer causes no real harm when its motion is very regular and ordered (laminar motion) because the resistive force is very small. However, on large bodies, like airplanes and trucks, the boundary layer is often chaotic because there are a lot of vortices and whirls (turbulent motion), which give a huge resistive force. The change of a boundary layer from laminar to turbulent is called laminar-turbulent transition. The knowledge of this change is essential information for the design of transport vehicles because it is critical to predict how much drag force is generated. This project seeks to study laminar-turbulent transition in air flowing over very fast airplanes. The focus is on the high-speed boundary layers over concave parts of the airplanes, like the bottom of the wing, because these curved surfaces are much more common than flat surfaces. These very fast flows also occur inside the engines, over turbine blades in particular, that compress gases to make the airplanes fly. A systematic theoretical and numerical study will be conducted in collaboration with researchers at the University of Sheffield to provide a complete understanding of when, where, and how a high-speed boundary layer flowing over concave solid surfaces transitions to turbulence. Integrated with the research effort, a variety of educational activities will be undertaken to showcase and instill the excitement of cyberphysics discovery in students at all levels, as well as to prepare a highly-trained workforce in high-speed flows and advanced cyberinfrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall objectives of this CBET-EPSRC proposal are to advance the fundamental understanding of all the stages of laminar-turbulent transition in compressible boundary layers flowing over concave solid surfaces, starting from the entrainment of the free-stream disturbances into a laminar boundary layer (i.e., the receptivity stage) through transition up to a fully turbulent flow. The inclusion of the receptivity stage is a fundamental ingredient for transition prediction that has not been previously explored for subsonic and supersonic boundary-layer flows subject to streamwise concave curvature. The proposed approach includes receptivity analysis based on advanced nonlinear asymptotic theory, boundary-layer instability computations, and direct numerical simulations (DNS). A systematic theoretical and numerical study will be conducted to clarify the role of Gortler vortices, streamwise-elongated, counter-rotating structures caused by concave curvature, the dynamics of which is extremely difficult to predict and control. The detailed study of boundary-layer physics will also be combined with large-eddy simulations (LES) and Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) to assess the performance of subgrid-scale (SGS) and RANS models for transitional flows dominated by Gortler vortices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002409.xml,"RISE 2019 Conference: Transforming University Engagement in Pre- and Post Disaster Environments: Lessons from Puerto Rico; Albany, New York; November 18-20, 2019",NSF,2019-11-15,2020-10-31,42760,"The devastation afflicted by Hurricane Maria on Puerto Rico resulted in nearly 3,000 deaths and over $90 billion of economic loss - one of the deadliest disasters on record in US history.  In response, faculty and staff from institutions of higher education nationwide traveled to Puerto Rico to provide research, service-learning, humanitarian relief, and student exchange.  While these efforts were well intended to help communities in need, the post-Maria experience demonstrated several aspects of the university-community relationship associated with pre- and post-disasters that are seldom analyzed in the disaster literature, and urgently in need of study.  In June 2018, University of Puerto Rico researchers spearheaded a gathering of representatives from mainland universities and colleges in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico to discuss the challenges and critical issues facing institutions of higher learning and the communities affected or threatened by extreme weather. The RISE 2019 National Conference, entitled Transforming University Engagement in Pre- and Post-Disaster Environments: Lessons from Puerto Rico, builds upon that initial meeting. Led by 25 institutions of higher education, the University at Albany, State University of New York, in collaboration with the University of Puerto Rico and the National Council of Science and the Environment (NCSE), will hold a 3-day conference at the University at Albany on November 18-20, 2019.  The conference will explore how universities and colleges can play a more impactful role in resilience planning and disaster recovery, while bringing to bear the power of higher education under an integrated framework.  RISE 2019 will promote the progress of science by building interconnections between academia and numerous sectors of society resulting in knowledge creation, knowledge exchange and future capacity building. Moreover, the conference will fortify our national security in a variety of ways including through 1) enhancing opportunities for future cross-domain, cross-sectorial research, training, and resource sharing that address the growing challenges posed by climate variability and weather extremes; b) fostering a nationwide coalition of partners across academia, government, and industry aimed at transforming higher education in addressing resilience through university hubs of innovation, including digitally connected communities; and c) raising awareness of resiliency resources to help local governments and policy makers advance strategies to mitigate the adverse impacts of extreme weather and climate variability.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RISE 2019 Conference program will incorporate three roundtables, five keynote/armchair discussions, twelve cohort sessions, and twenty-eight panel discussions.  Each session will be aimed at exploring key questions, discussing existing and novel research methodologies and scientific approaches, engaging scholars and practitioners nationwide, while charting new pathways through which the RISE consortium of partners can lead post conference efforts to develop a national e-learning framework for higher education. In so doing, RISE 2019 will serve to broaden awareness of and inform NSF supported research and scholarship through programs such as the Extreme Events Research (EER) Networks, the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI), among other extramurally supported research programs at NSF and beyond. ""CONVERGE"" is one such example of a significant NSF supported initiative, which serves to coordinate hazards and disaster researchers and link them to the existing NHERI scientific plan, facilities, cyberinfrastructure, and technological resources.  Through RISE 2019 conference deliberations, and thereafter, hopes to promote and support the development of a national interdisciplinary and inter-university network of public and private sector partners to tackle the multi-faceted challenges of disaster preparedness, response, recovery, adaptation and overall community resilience. The three-day conference structure is designed to foster the dissemination and exchange of knowledge and discovery, as well as the forging of new scientific collaborations and practitioner partnerships. As a result, RISE 2019 will generate actionable information that will lead to the post conference development of a sustainable national framework for higher education interconnecting with government, industry and nonprofit organizations - one that incorporates best practices, case studies, new knowledge, novel research, shared resources and collaboration mechanisms to be more impactful in pre- and post-disaster environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000862.xml,Expanding Technical Career Pathways in Manufacturing for High School Students,NSF,2020-07-01,2024-06-30,584943,"Engineering technology programs create pathways for students to pursue technical careers in manufacturing companies. Industry demand for skilled manufacturing technicians continues to grow nationally and even more so in the Salt Lake City, Utah region. The number of students enrolled in the Salt Lake Community College (SLCC) engineering technology program has not kept pace with the increased demand for technicians in the region. Given regional demographics, there is also an opportunity to broaden participation of women and minorities in the manufacturing workforce. Regional middle and high schools that serve a diverse population have tried several approaches to increase the awareness of students about and better prepare them for the technical trades. SLCC will collaborate in this effort with the local school district to increase the number of skilled technicians in the region.  The project will do so by building upon a existing, successful model and by offering an engineering technology certificate program for high school students. Upon graduation from high school, students will be prepared to enter the workforce directly or to earn an Associate of Applied Science in Engineering Technology from SLCC after one additional year of study. Given the diverse student population participating in the certificate program, this project will help broaden participation of underrepresented students in the technical workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Jordan School District, within the Salt Lake City, Utah metropolitan area, has demonstrated success with the nationally available Prefreshman Engineering Program (PREP).  PREP includes three years of voluntary, yet extensive, summer programming designed to improve middle school students’ understanding of STEM content and make them aware of locally available technical careers.  The Jordan School District PREP program draws from a diverse population of students and has had high retention rates across multiple years of cohorts. The goal of this project is to increase the number and diversity of students in the engineering technology program at SLCC, and to support their success and entry into workforce, thus addressing regional industry needs.  This project will:  (1) add an additional year of PREP at Jordan School District to extend the program into high school; (2) provide early connections between PREP students with SLCC engineering resources; and (3) provide high school students with on-site education at SLCC leading to a certificate in engineering technology, as a one-year waypoint toward a full two-year degree by the time they graduate from high school.  The certificate program and the two-year degree program will be based on a competency-based learning strategy, which will free students from traditional scheduling constraints and lead to greater engagement with faculty. Using institutional data and student surveys, the project will assess the effects of the extended PREP program components on student persistence and program completion. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002778.xml,Convex Body Shape Recovery via Geometric Measures and Inequalities,NSF,2020-06-01,2021-05-31,159159,"The central theme of this project is the recovery of boundary shape of a geometric object using partial data given as local or global geometric measurements (such as areas and volumes). These geometric objects, similar to the objects we see around us, can possess edges and vertices (such as a square), but can be so much more complicated (for example, possessing a fractal structure). Problems of this nature arise in many engineering/designing problems (such as the designing of antenna reflector) in addition to many other areas out of mathematics (such as economics). Moreover, these problems are well connected with other areas of mathematics, including PDE and functional analysis. Another benefit of these problems is that in various special cases, they are visually understandable and solvable by motivated undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The recently posed dual Minkowski problem and Lp dual Minkowski problem are two Minkowski-type problems that received much attention. The principal investigator, through collaboration, has gained a good understanding of the solutions when one assumes origin-symmetry of the data and the convex body. There, the final solutions depend very much on convex bodies with non-smooth boundaries. An understanding in the non-symmetric case is imperative and is one of the goals. The challenge is to identify and solve the proper optimization problem. Another goal is to understand how an optimization problem involving two bodies can help in this setting. The same phenomenon can be observed when one considers the antenna reflector design problem with decay. The Aleksandrov-Fenchel inequality is one of the deepest results in convex geometry and emcompasses many isoperimetric inequalities. The equality condition remains quite mysterious as even in the simple cases, bodies with fractal boundary structures can arise as extremal cases. The PI will study the characterization of the support set of mixed area measures which is essential in understanding the equality condition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Arithmetic statistics is the study of number-theoretic objects in aggregates, rather than in isolation. This study takes many different forms, several of which will be pursued in this project. The general philosophy behind the project is the interplay between theory and computation in number theory.  On one hand, initial understanding of the behavior of many classes of number-theoretic objects is generally driven by the study of explicit examples; however, production of a sufficient supply of examples often depends on theory that will underpin the accuracy and range of computations. This project will lead to a deeper understanding of the statistics of fundamental behaviors of numbers. The strategies and techniques that will be utilized in this project originate in a broad range of other mathematical subjects, including analysis, geometry, algebra and in some cases, statistics. <br/><br/>The PI will study a range of problems concerning zeta functions and L-functions associated to algebraic varieties over finite fields, function fields in positive characteristic, and number fields. These include statistical problems about point counts, in both the arithmetic aspect (Sato-Tate distributions for abelian varieties over Q and other number fields) and the geometric aspect (averages over geometric objects over a fixed finite field); algorithmic determination of L-functions; and enumeration and tabulation of function fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001328.xml,"I-Corps: Accurate, Contiguous and Portable Wireless Intraocular Contact Lens Pressure Sensors",NSF,2020-02-01,2021-08-31,50000,"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a device to monitor high eye pressure (intraocular pressure or IOP), the only known sign of glaucoma, which could cause vision loss and influence patients’ quality of life. Glaucoma is a leading  cause of blindness for people over 60 years old and affects approximately 3 million people in the USA. The incidence of glaucoma is expected to rise to 76 million by 2020 and 112 million people by 2040 worldwide.  Unfortunately, glaucoma is not curable, but it is manageable with proper treatments. Although IOP is a highly dynamic parameter, conventional measurements fail to track it for a 24-hour period. A compact and portable wireless contact lens sensor (CLS) system can enable continuous, real-time monitoring of IOP and ensure clinical safety and patient comfort. This type of system could be adapted for other pressure measurements in other parts of the body as well. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of parity-time (PT) symmetry in quantum mechanics into radio-frequency (RF) telemetric sensing systems, enabling new ways to enhance resolution, accuracy, and sensitivity of versatile zero-power wireless pressure sensors (e.g., intraocular, intracranial and other biological pressures). Specifically, the team’s PT telemetry technologies employed an active loss-compensation circuit, which not only can compensate the power dissipation in minimally-invasive microsensors, but also allows a large shift of peak frequency under changes in vital physiological factors (i.e., a higher sensitivity), thanks to the eigenvalue bifurcation effect around the exceptional points found in PT systems. This wireless readout technology will be exploited to continuously record IOP levels from a biocompatible, monolithically microfabricated CLS, with enhanced sensitivity and resolvability. In addition, machine learning and signal processing algorithms will be exploited to address the long-term stability and signal drift issues in the practical IOP monitoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Bryophytes and lichens are functionally related as the main hosts for cryptobiotic communities forming minute ""forests"" that provide a matrix of habitats for many microscopic organisms, including tardigrades, mites, rotifers, micro-mollusks, microalgae, microfungi, and prokaryotes. These communities have global relevance and perform essential functions on our planet, for example, the biological soil crusts that harbor these communities form a ""living skin"" covering approximately 12% of  Earth's terrestrial surface.  In addition, professional training will be provided for a large number of undergraduates, with a focus on leveraging local resources to promote underrepresented students in STEM fields.  Students will be trained in digitization and collections management, and will contribute to the education and public outreach components of the project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this collaboration, twenty-five US herbaria will image and digitize associated metadata for almost 1.2 million bryophyte and lichen herbarium specimens held in US institutions. Imaging the physical specimens of these organisms and integrating data from comparative genomics, nucleotide sequence data, and other resources is unprecedented on this scale. These integrated data will form a critical resource for evolutionary and ecological studies, that may, in turn, lead to a deeper understanding of (1) how biocrusts perform their ecosystem functions, (2) the roles of bryophytes and lichens in carbon/nitrogen cycling, (3) the dynamic evolution of symbioses in space and time, (4) the historical and contemporary drivers of endophyte co-diversification, and (5) the evolution of biodiversity using spatial phylogenetics. Deep-learning approaches using repurposed digital images may also provide powerful new investigative tools.  Digitized data will be shared with iDigBio.org and other repositories.  A multi-pronged approach to broader impacts spans from K-12 to participatory citizen science initiatives.  These include (1) diverse digital, interactive, and object-based learning outreach programs; (2) online lesson plans; (3) science youth groups; (4) Science Clubs and public educator workshops; and (5) a series of videos using Learning Glass – which collapses the perspectives of viewer and presenter into one shared perspective. In addition, the PIs and collaborating institutions will host WeDigBio and K-12 clubs hosting label transcription crowdsourcing events during the award period. The project also partners with Zooniverse, leaders in online citizen science, where we will develop an online platform for citizen scientists to make observations on character traits that can then enhance metadata not always on the scientific label data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000996.xml,COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: Orbital-scale Variability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and the Formation of Bottom Water in the Ross Sea during the Pliocene-Pleistocene,NSF,2020-09-01,2023-08-31,79851,"Part I: Non-technical description: &lt;br/&gt;Predicting how polar ice sheets will respond to future global warming is difficult because all the processes that contribute to their melting are not well understood. This is important because the more ice on land that melts, the higher sea levels will rise. The most significant uncertainty in current estimates of sea-level rise in the coming decades is the potential contribution from the Antarctic Ice Sheet. One way to increase our knowledge about how large ice sheets respond to climate change in response to natural factors is to examine the geologic past. Natural global warming (and cooling) events in Earth’s history provide examples that we can use to better understand processes, interactions, and responses we can’t directly observe today. One such time period, approximately three million years ago (known as the Pliocene), was the last time atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were as high as they are today and, therefore, represents a time period to study to better understand the ice sheet response to a warming climate. Specifically, this project is interested in understanding how ocean currents near Antarctica, which transport heat and store carbon, behaved during these past climate events. The history of past ice sheet-ocean interactions are recorded in sediments that were deposited, layer upon layer, in the deep sea offshore Antarctica. In January-February 2018, a team of scientists and crew set sail to the Ross Sea, offshore west Antarctica, on the scientific ocean drilling vessel JOIDES Resolution to recover such sediment archives. This project focuses on a sediment core from that expedition, which captures the relatively warm Pliocene time interval, as well as the subsequent transition into cooler climates typical of the past two million years. The researchers will analyze the sediment with multiple complementary measurements, including: grain size, composition, chemistry of organic matter, physical structures, microfossil type and abundance, and more. These analyses will be done by the research team, including several students, at their respective laboratories and will then integrated into a unified record of ice sheet-ocean interactions. Ultimately, the results will be used to improve modeled projections of how the Antarctic Ice Sheet could respond to future climate change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part II: Technical description: &lt;br/&gt;Geological records from the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) margin demonstrate that the ice sheet oscillated in response to orbital variations in insolation (i.e., ~400, 100, 41, and 20 kyr), and it appears to be more sensitive to specific frequencies that regulate mean annual insolation (i.e., 41-kyr obliquity), particularly when the ice sheet extends into marine environments and is impacted by ocean circulation. However, the relationship between orbital forcing and the production of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) is unconstrained. Thus, a knowledge gap exists in understanding how changing insolation impacts ice marginal and Southern Ocean conditions that directly influence ventilation of the global ocean. The researchers hypothesize that insolation-driven changes directly affected the production and export of AABW to the Southern Ocean from the Pliocene through the Pleistocene. For example, obliquity amplification during the warmer Pliocene may have led to enhanced production and export of dense waters from the shelf due to reduced AIS extent, which, in turn, led to greater AABW outflow. To determine the relationship of AABW production to orbital regime, they plan to reconstruct both from a single, continuous record from the levee of Hillary Canyon, a major conduit of AABW outflow, on the Ross Sea continental rise. To test their hypothesis, they will analyze sediment from IODP Site U1524 (recovered in 2018 during International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 374) and focus on three data sets. (1) They will use the occurrence, frequency, and character of mm-scale turbidite beds as a proxy of dense-shelf-water cascading outflow and AABW production. They will estimate the down-slope flux via numerical modeling of turbidity current properties using morphology, grain size, and bed thickness as input parameters. (2) They will use grain-size data, physical properties, XRF core scanning, CT imaging, and hyperspectral imaging to guide lithofacies analysis to infer processes occurring during glacial, deglacial, and interglacial periods. Statistical techniques and optimization methods will be applied to test for astronomical forcing of sedimentary packages in order to provide a cyclostratigraphic framework and interpret the orbital-forcing regime. (3) They will use bulk sedimentary carbon and nitrogen abundance and isotope data to determine how relative contributions of terrigenous and marine organic matter change in response to orbital forcing. All of these data will be integrated with sedimentological records to deconvolve organic matter production from its deposition or remobilization due to AABW outflow as a function of the oscillating extent of the AIS. These data sets will be integrated into a unified chronostratigraphy to determine the relationship between AABW outflow and orbital-forcing scenarios under the varying climate regimes of the Plio-Pleistocene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Kylerec workshop aims to introduce aspiring mathematicians in the fields of symplectic and contact geometry and from many institutions to vibrant areas of research, fostering collaboration, forming strong research ties between young researchers, and thus promoting future collaboration and research. The workshop is specifically designed to encourage the development of a diverse group of researchers in the fields of symplectic and contact geometry. It is a week-long intensive workshop, in which all activities occur under one roof. The lectures are delivered by the graduate student participants with the help of three to four mentors, who are emerging expert researchers in the field. This setup enhances communication skills, encourages active involvement of the participants and forging new collaborations.<br/><br/>The student organizers for the 2020 Kylerec workshop are Orsola Capovilla-Searle (Duke University), Dahye Cho (Stony Brook University), Francois-Simon Fauteux-Chapleau (Stanford University), Tim Large (MIT) and Sarah McConnell (Stanford University). The topic is Quantitative Symplectic Geometry, with a focus on symplectic embedding problems. The deceptively simple question of when does one symplectic manifold embed inside another, and the subtle dependance of this question on quantitative parameters, has been a focal point of the subject for the last thirty years. Since Gromov's celebrated non-squeezing result, a variety of techniques drawing upon ideas in dynamical systems, toric algebraic geometry and four-dimensional gauge theory have been used to better understand such problems; yet a systematic understanding has eluded researchers thus far. The objective of the 2020 Kylerec workshop is to understand the current state of knowledge on such questions, covering both the methods researchers have developed to produce surprising symplectic embeddings, as well as the technical tools of Floer theory and embedded contact homology that have been used to provide state-of-the-art obstructions to the existence of a symplectic embedding.

2002971.xml,Collaborative Research: Dynamic interactions of individual neurons in supporting hippocampal network oscillations during behavior,NSF,2020-10-01,2025-09-30,620217,"Cognitive and motor behavior in the brain is controlled by networks of highly interconnected neurons. Neurons communicate via signals called spikes, which are generated by complex biological mechanisms. These mechanisms crucially depend on the subthreshold membrane potential activity, which is controlled by the complex interaction of ionic currents among other factors. Although the spiking patterns of the individual neurons are typically not regular, certain neuronal networks produce periodic oscillatory patterns. Important among them is the theta rhythm (4-10 Hz), which has been recorded in various brain areas by global activity measures, such as electroencephalography (EEG) or extracellular local field potentials (LFPs). Theta oscillations have been observed during motor activity and REM sleep, and are thought to play important roles in navigation, episodic memory and learning. Theta oscillations have also been observed at the subthreshold membrane potential level in brain slice preparations, and in behaving animals in the hippocampal CA1 area. However, how the oscillatory activity at the network level is linked to the biophysical properties of individual neurons remains largely unknown. In this project, the investigators will address this question using a combined experimental/theoretical approach. The Boston University team will perform experiments in behaving animals in CA1, and the NJIT team will carry out detailed computational modeling. This research is expected to generate a framework for describing and understanding how high-level neuronal oscillations depend on the oscillatory activity of individual neurons through complex network interactions. The PIs will also work to disseminate their imaging technology to the scientific community. This project will contribute to the cross-disciplinary training  of students and postdoctoral trainees in both experimental and computational neuroscience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central hypothesis of this project is that theta oscillations in the hippocampus are generated by resonant mechanisms involving the intrinsic properties of individual neurons, and circuit interactions that are tuned to amplify theta frequency inputs from the medial septum and possibly other external sources. We will address this hypothesis from an interdisciplinary perspective involving in vivo experiments, computational modeling, and dynamical systems analysis. We aim to understand the cellular and circuit mechanisms of hippocampal theta oscillations in vivo, and to create a theoretical framework to describe the biophysical and dynamic links between the oscillatory properties of individual neurons and network oscillations. The Boston University team will deploy a novel voltage imaging technique to measure subthreshold voltage dynamics and spiking activity from individual hippocampal neurons of defined cell types, including pyramidal cells and local interneurons (e.g. parvalbumim (PV)- and somatostatin (SOM)- positive ones) during behavioral states with varying levels of LFP theta oscillations. Additionally, to test the causal role of these interneurons in supporting theta oscillations, precision optogenetic activation and silencing will be used. The NJIT team will build biophysical models of the hippocampal network that include the intrinsic subthreshold oscillatory properties of the participating neurons and inputs from other areas (e.g., medial septum) to produce theta LFP oscillations. The results of the proposed research will provide mechanistic insights on the formation of hippocampal CA1 network oscillations with implications to learning, memory and other cognitive functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

CI has become of growing importance to nearly all NSF research, which makes increasing use of computational simulations and large-data analytics methods. The results will be published in an open report as well as in multiple journal papers. The results will contribute to and leverage new ideas in cluster, cloud, and data analytics computing for the benefit of the research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The architectural similarities between the above issues, and the fact that high performance clusters typically make up the major compute nodes of computational grids and clouds, means that deployment, operational, and usage issues surrounding computational clouds form a superset of the issues that revolve around clusters. The workshop will focus on five tasks: (1) survey and analyze the key deployment, operational, and usage issues for clusters, clouds, and data analytics-- focusing especially on discontinuities produced by multicore and hybrid architectures, data-intensive science, and the increasing need for wide-area/local-area interaction; (2) document the current state-of-the-art in each of these areas, identifying interesting questions and limitations; (3) discuss experiences with clusters, clouds, and data relative to the research communities and science domains benefiting from the technology; (4) explore interoperability among disparate clouds and between various clouds and grids and their impact on domain sciences; and (5) explore directions for future research and development against the background of disruptive trends and technologies and the recognized gaps in the current state-of-the-art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Enabling FL over wireless multi-hop networks, such as wireless community mesh networks and wireless Internet over satellite constellations, not only can augment AI experiences for urban mobile users, but also can democratize AI and make it accessible in a low-cost manner to everyone, including  people in low-income communities, rural areas, under-developed regions, and disaster areas. The overall objective of this project is to develop a novel wireless multi-hop FL system with guaranteed stability, high accuracy and fast convergence speed. This project is expected to advance the design of distributed deep learning (DL) systems, to promote the understanding of the strong synergy between distributed computing and distributed networking, and to bridge the gap between the theoretical foundations of distributed DL and its real-life applications. The project will also provide unique interdisciplinary training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students through both research work and related courses that the PIs will develop and offer. <br/> <br/>This project proposes to use concepts of federated learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning to provide optimal solutions for training DL models over wireless multi-hop networks that have communication constraints due to noisy and interference-rich wireless links.

2002261.xml,CAREER: Ultrasound-based Intent Modeling and Control Framework for Neurorehabilitation and Educating Children with Disabilities and High School Students,NSF,2019-09-01,2023-11-30,391134,"Each year, more than 17,000 people in the United States experience a spinal cord injury. Individuals suffering from incomplete spinal cord injuries may have voluntary control of their limbs, but their strength is weakened compared to able-bodied persons. Neurorehabilitation is a therapeutic approach used to recover limb function in individuals suffering from incomplete spinal cord injury; robotic or electrical stimulation devices encourage repair of the person's nervous system through repeated, assisted exercise. The amount of assistance the device provides is based upon the user's remaining muscle function. However, correctly measuring a person's voluntary effort during therapeutic exercise is a significant technical challenge. Discrepancies in the measurement can cause the robot to provide too much or too little assistance, which can slow recovery and lead to falls during robot-assisted walking. To address the technical challenge of sensing of voluntary effort, this project will integrate ultrasound imaging with electromyography-based (i.e., electrical signals) measurement of ankle muscles that govern walking. The use of ultrasound imaging will allow direct visualization and measurement of muscle activity and minimizes interference of electrical signals from neighboring muscles. Ultrasound imaging will also be investigated as an approach for optimizing electrode placement to initiate multi-plane ankle movements. The study will test the hypothesis that ultrasound imaging-based measurement of voluntary effort is more accurate than electromyography-based prediction alone. Research and education are integrated through student-led construction of ultrasound imaging and electromyography-based human-machine interaction platforms for children with special needs. The human-machine interaction platforms may accelerate learning in children with special needs and offers research opportunities for high school-age students from underrepresented groups in STEM. <br/><br/>The PI's long-term career goal is to build a full-scale, feedforward musculoskeletal model that predicts human intent by obtaining signals from wearable ultrasound sensors attached to different limb muscles. Toward this goal, the project will derive control strategies that use ultrasound imaging to predict weakened voluntary effort of a person with incomplete spinal cord injury and provide assistance as-needed during walking with a hybrid exoskeleton. The research objectives of the proposal are to: (1) formulate an ultrasound imaging-based observer to predict voluntary effort in ankle muscles and (2) use the prediction in an ankle control strategy. An optimal ultrasound imaging-derived surrogate signal to measure voluntary effort will be determined, and a functional mapping between the surrogate signals and voluntary effort will be formulated. The stability and convergence conditions for the observer and the ankle controller will be established. The new intent prediction and control framework will be directly compared to electromyography-based prediction and control methods. Functional electrical stimulation of the ankle muscles that produce multi-plane ankle movements will also be investigated. To target the intended ankle muscle, ultrasound imaging-based feedback will be evaluated to optimize current in the stimulation electrodes. The project facilitates a breakthrough rehabilitation therapy that uses non-invasive, wearable ultrasound sensors to collect, monitor, and control muscle activity of persons with incomplete spinal cord injury.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

CPS and IoT systems connect sophisticated computer networks to physical world objects and machines. This combination poses new concerns over information security and physical safety than are posed by traditional information technology (IT) systems. This project will develop methodologies, algorithms, and tools for the design of safety-critical systems, including both multiprocessor systems-on-chips (MPSoCs) and networked control systems.  Threats may come from information security vulnerabilities as well as safety-related faults.  The methodologies and tools developed by this project will enable system designers to harden their designs against known attacks. These methods can also be used after system deployment to redesign system components to reduce their vulnerability to emergent threats. The project would also help develop new curriculum and train US workforce in the important area of information security and would be inclusive of the women, minority, and underrepresented groups in this endeavor.<br/><br/>This project develops a new methodology for attack-aware design for safety-critical cyber-physical and Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems. A formal, multilayer model is used to describe the system. New design-time re-synthesis methods analyze the system for potential attacks and modify the system to mitigate the attacks. The methodology considers both functional attacks and timing-oriented quality-of-service attacks. Mitigations may be applied at multiple levels: middleware, operating system, and hardware. Attack mitigation is posed as an optimization problem. A set of mitigations is selected based on cost and on the number of mitigations applied for each valid computation. The methodology is applicable to networked systems at multiple scales, including both multiprocessor systems-on-chips used in smartphones and networked control systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Polymers, which are comprised of repeated molecular units bonded together, are ubiquitous, from plastic products to DNA. By controlling the identity and linkages of the molecular units, the properties of polymers can be finely tuned, which has led to an explosion of new products and applications. Despite these advances, it is still extremely difficult to systematically and precisely control the sequence of the molecular units in a polymer. With this level of control, new polymers could be developed for information storage, textiles and fabrics, nano-sensors, and drug discovery and delivery. To accomplish this tough but transformative chemistry, C-GEM Is adapting two complementary approaches. First, C-GEM is re-engineering the ribosome to build bonds between molecules in sequence, much like natural ribosomes build proteins by assembling alpha-amino acids in sequence. Second, C-GEM is purposefully expanding the structures of natural polypeptides in ways that dramatically increase their chemical diversity and function. C-GEM also engages and trains diverse groups of students and postdoctoral researchers in collaborative teams at a rich new interface of chemistry, biology, and materials science. C-GEM also engages citizen scientists with a scientific discovery game, EteRNA, that introduces interested gamers to the key concepts of RNA structure, stability, and function. New EteRNA Challenges focus on the chemistry of the ribosome. Overall, C-GEM is establishing a future of bespoke polymers to address health, environmental, and industrial challenges, fostering innovation, and training a diverse workforce at multiple chemistry-biology-materials frontiers.<br/><br/>C-GEM’s Phase II research plan includes interrelated goals that will expand ribosome-mediated chemistry to generate molecular architectures unique in both structure and function. C-GEM is also pursuing a parallel path in which innovative “late-stage functionalization” reactions convert ribosome-derived products into substances beyond the reach of extant biosynthesis. Novel and versatile tools to design, evolve, and characterize the molecules of translation will expand their chemical capacity in vitro and in vivo. C-GEM will also use new and existing technologies to determine the structures of the genetically encoded product molecules and polymers, as well as the mechanisms by which they are assembled. A suite of computational methods will evaluate, model, and predict the chemical capacity of wild type and engineered ribosomes, their translation factors, and the properties of the polymers they produce, signaling a new era in computational biomaterial design. Our goals also include strategies to prepare sequence-defined chemical polymers in useful quantities, enabling functions that impact biotechnology, in vivo imaging, molecular medicine, materials science, and drug delivery.

2002310.xml,Collaborative Research: Dry-Wet Phase Inversion Pathway of Graphene Oxide (GO)-Based Mixed-Matrix Membranes for Mineral Ions Separation by Membrane Distillation,NSF,2020-08-01,2025-07-31,204323,"Increasing pollution and water scarcity have created the need to access and recover unconventional water sources. One such source is high-salinity produced water, which surfaces from underground during oil or gas production. Produced water has an excess concentration of minerals and does not meet the regulatory standards of acceptable quality for drinking water. However, by removing these undesirable constituents, the produced water can be reused for agricultural applications such as irrigation, livestock watering, and aquaculture. Therefore, identifying a process to desalinate produced water is of great societal importance. Reverse osmosis is a pressure-driven membrane process used to desalinate water containing relatively low mineral concentrations, such as groundwater. The mineral concentrations of produced water are sufficiently high that reverse osmosis is unsuitable for desalination. Membrane distillation is a promising alternative technology capable of separating minerals from high-salinity water due to its unique thermal-membrane characteristics. Graphene oxide-based membranes, with their efficient antifouling properties, are expected to enhance the membrane distillation process. Graphene oxide-based membranes are fabricated using a state-of-the-art method called phase inversion. Phase inversion produces these membranes by integrating graphene oxide directly into the polymeric materials. This project sets out to develop a detailed fundamental and mechanistic understanding of the role that graphene oxide plays in a novel dry-wet phase inversion synthesis to produce membranes for membrane distillation. This project will also combine research and education activities to train a new generation of experts in the versatile area of membrane technology, particularly as applied to water treatment.<br/><br/>Membrane technology for water desalination and treatment of produced water has the potential to fundamentally alter the way society views water reuse. Augmenting water treatment capacity will allow rural, arid, and isolated regions with limited access to water, to have portable and reliable membrane systems for treating water. Advancing promising membrane separation processes for desalination, such as membrane distillation, requires access to fundamental knowledge of functional materials and structure-property relationship to engineer effective membranes. Membrane distillation is an energy-efficient alternative to multi-stage flash and multi-effect distillation processes and can be configured to concentrate brines. However, application of membrane distillation at scale is limited by the lack of suitable membranes exhibiting high permeate flux, water recovery, and resistance to scaling. The goal of this project is to establish and understand the dry-wet phase inversion membrane development approach to overcome these limitations in utility for produced water purification. Graphene oxide is a versatile anti-fouling nanomaterial that will be used in the synthesis of mixed-matrix membranes with properties specific to application in membrane distillation. Three research objectives are defined to provide fundamental insights into the dry-wet phase inversion process. In the first objective, the investigators will establish the role of graphene oxide sheet pH on pore formation and hydrophobic properties and determine the mechanism of dispersion of graphene oxide. The second objective examines ion retention on dry-wet phase inversion graphene oxide-based membranes during membrane distillation. And the third objective focuses on characterizing of the chemical, thermal, and mechanical stability of the dry-wet phase inversion graphene oxide-based membranes. Together, this knowledge will form a foundation for advancing membrane distillation for high-salinity water purification.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this research activity is to study repeated auction markets where the bidders have incomplete information about the items being auctioned, and analyze the resulting dynamic bidding behavior. Such auctions arise in online advertising markets and play a significant role in sustaining a wide range of services available on the Internet. The insights obtained from this research will be used to evaluate and improve the design and operation of such markets. The PI is committed to involving students from underrepresented groups into this research program, and will engage in outreach efforts through various outreach programs at Cornell University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The learning incentives inherent in repeated auction markets require each bidder to evaluate the effects of his or her actions and those of his or her competitors on the future evolution of the market state. In order to understand how a bidder behaves in such settings, this research will first use the tools of dynamic programming to obtain insights about the structure of the bidder's optimal strategy for given fixed strategies of her competitors. Using these structural insights, the researcher will then characterize the resulting equilibrium in the market where each bidder reacts optimally to others. We will develop algorithms based on iterative schemes to approximately compute such equilibria and numerically analyze how the design of the market affects its equilibrium properties. We will use the numerical investigations to identify practical guidelines for improving the design and operation of repeated auction markets, in terms of maximizing its revenue and overall efficiency."

Using wideband receivers to capture in-band and out-of-band signals, these impairments can jointly serve as unique signatures for transmitters, thereby increasing classification accuracy and scalability. The second thrust integrates hand-engineered features with models acquired through RF domain knowledge and leverages input-output function mapping acquired through deep learning to assimilate meaningful representations from raw IQ data.

Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger. The IoT is a system of interconnected computing devices on which the emergence of 5G technology has an accelerating effect. The M2M economy is a collection of machines acting as economic agents that autonomously interact through sequences of transactions. Blockchain technology enables the registry of these transactions whose logic is articulated and coded in the form of smart contracts. These technologies have transformational potential and hold the promise of unprecedented economic growth, but they come with many vulnerabilities. This research contributes to the progress of science, advancement of prosperity and welfare, and securing the national defense through a new mechanism to enable security and cost efficient interactions on M2M platforms. The novel idea is to design market incentives such that services among machines are bought and sold based not only on their cost but also on the cyber-riskiness of the devices providing those services.<br/><br/>The project envisions decentralized systems that are self-adapting to cyber-risk and facilitate security and cost efficient interactions on platforms based on blockchain and IoT. The challenges are lack of: (a) real-time market design and self-optimization mechanisms; (b) scalable approaches for real-time attack identification across programs and high-level logics; (c) methods to assess M2M specific attack impact. Responding to these challenges, this project interprets the problem of creating a cyber-secure and economically efficient IoT/blockchain-based ecosystem as one of designing large-scale interconnected markets. Each of these markets has a price adjustment mechanism that may discriminate based on real-time cyber-risk. Collectively, these markets give rise to an overall emergent property of cyber-risks and economic efficiency self-adaptive optimization. Vulnerability assessment is the key to generate cyber-risk and price appropriate adjustments. This project comprehensively assesses M2M specific vulnerabilities by articulating attack graphs, hence contributing to characterizing the cyber-risk of decentralized applications for smart contract platforms. By using tools of random graph theory and percolation theory, the project provides a representative mathematical framework for understanding the cyber-risk of a IoT/blockchain-based ecosystem.

Given the sensitivity of flowering times to climatic conditions, a thorough understanding of how plants respond to changing environments is necessary for predicting the consequences for pollinators, herbivores, parasites, and plant populations. A record of historical flowering times is found within the nation's herbaria – collections of dried and pressed plants. In 2018, the California Phenology Thematic Collections Network (CAP-TCN) was established to advance our understanding of flowering time changes over time. The network brought together 22 California universities, research stations, natural history collections, and botanical gardens, with the goal of imaging and recording the flowering status of approximately one million herbarium specimens collected over the past 150 years. These data are freely available through the newly established Consortium of California Herbaria (CCH2) portal. This project will add a partnership of seven new collections and six new institutions to the CAP-TCN, contributing an additional 150,000 herbarium specimens. The project participants will be fully integrated into CAP-TCN training and outreach activities including Notes from Nature online expeditions, which educate and involve members of the public in learning about herbarium specimens and flowering phenology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By expanding the geographic scope to encompass Oregon and the northern Baja California peninsula, the CAP-TCN will now cover the entire California Floristic Province, a biodiversity hotspot of global significance. This will increase the number of species with imaged specimens across their entire range from 1,217 to 1,850, a 55% increase. The addition of 80,000 Oregon and Baja California specimens to CCH2 will facilitate efficient specimen-based analyses of the entire California Floristic Province and for the first time allow a more objective and reproducible specimen-based delineation of its geographic boundaries.

That global warming ended the last Ice Age and paved the way for human expansion and diversification. Scientists have known for decades that this warming was associated with rising concentrations of greenhouse gases, including both carbon dioxide and methane, but have been unable to pinpoint what caused the greenhouses gases to increase. Recent research has shed new light on geologic processes in the ocean that may have influenced the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Using geochemical methods, scientists have uncovered evidence that CO2 was released from deep sea volcanic provinces in the eastern equatorial Pacific at the end of the last Ice Age. This discovery is important because the eastern equatorial Pacific is one of the primary conduits through which CO2 from the ocean is released to the atmosphere. In the current project the research team will use similar geochemical methods to investigate whether there were other sites in the ocean where volcanic carbon was released at the end of the last Ice Age and whether ocean currents carried more carbon to the eastern equatorial Pacific as the Earth warmed. The results from this research should help answer one of the Grand Challenges in climate science, what regulated the concentration of atmospheric CO2 during one of Earth's largest climatic changes. The project will support one early career researcher and undergraduate and graduate students at both institutions, one of which is a Minority/Hispanic-Serving Institution where most students are first in family attendees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two hypotheses have been put forth to explain large radiocarbon (14C) excursions and positive pCO2 anomalies in the Eastern Equatorial and Subtropical Pacific (EEP) during the last glacial termination. One hypothesis calls upon ventilation of respired metabolic carbon from a formerly isolated deep-sea reservoir through the Southern Ocean, and advection of that carbon to low latitudes via Antarctic Intermediate Water. This hypothesis has received support from Nd isotope results from the eastern tropical Pacific that document lower values during the Heinrich Stadial 1(HS1) and the Younger Dryas (YD) climate events, interpreted to reflect an increased proportion of southern sourced waters. The other hypothesis calls upon localized releases of geologic carbon from hydrothermal systems in the EEP that increased carbon flux to the surface ocean. This hypothesis has received additional support from a recent study that documented increased accumulation of hydrothermal metals in the marine sediments of the EEP in association with the large 14C excursions. It is possible that both mechanisms contributed to the radiocarbon anomalies and to an increased flux of ""old"" carbon to the atmosphere through the EEP upwelling system. Testing each hypothesis requires additional data from sites outside of the EEP and particularly from regions in the vicinity of where intermediate waters are formed. The researchers here will test the origin of the ""old"" carbon in the EEP by studying ventilation (14C) and water mass (eNd, Ba/Ca) proxies at multiple sites that lay in the path of intermediate waters feeding the equatorial Pacific from the North and South. If results from this study do not support old-carbon transfer via intermediate circulation, it will increase the likelihood of a local carbon reservoir as the source of old carbon in the EEP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A central theme in theoretical physics is electric-magnetic duality, the symmetry between electricity and magnetism in Maxwell's equations and its generalization to idealized (supersymmetric) variants of the equations that govern the weak and strong nuclear forces. One of the central themes in number theory is the Langlands program, a profound link between arithmetic and geometry that counts among its successes the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. A surprisingly close analogy between these two themes has been developed in the last decade. This project employs structures that are natural in physics to provide crucial insights missing in the number theory -- specifically, the behavior of boundaries or edges in physics suggests a new understanding of the use of integral calculus in arithmetic. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop new connections between physics and number theory. Electric-magnetic duality, the symmetry between electricity and magnetism (a variant of the Fourier transform), and its generalization (S-duality) to supersymmetric variants of the nonabelian gauge theories that describe fundamental interactions, can be considered analogous to the Langlands program, a profound nonabelian analog of the Fourier transform linking arithmetic questions to the algebra and analysis of symmetry groups. This project will take insights from physics (the understanding of electric-magnetic duality for boundary conditions) and apply them to fundamental problems in number theory (the connection between period integrals and the arithmetic of L-functions). The investigator will work to disseminate physics ideas to number theorists and vice versa, bridging two intellectually distant communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As such, it has broad applications not only within mathematics but also in many fields of science from medicine to physics. The subject has developed for over 200 years, but there are many fresh problems and new directions. Commutative algebra is a subject that lies at the intersection of algebraic geometry and number theory. Since the advent of powerful and easily available computing resources, the possibilities for experimentation within commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, and their applications has multiplied. A byproduct of this project will be the further development of these computational tools. Cohen-Macaulay modules and sheaves play a role in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry that is a natural analogue of the role of finite dimensional representations in the case of finite dimensional algebras. The Principal Investigator will work on projects in commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, and computational methods that center around the theory of Cohen-Macaulay modules over particularly interesting classes of varieties: Toric varieties, complete intersections, and residual intersections. The PI will also continue to train graduate students in related research fields and actively be involved in several highly recognized outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator will work on Ulrich modules and Clifford Algebras.

2000487.xml,Using Neural Networks for Automated Classification of Elementary Mathematics Instructional Activities,NSF,2020-09-01,2025-08-31,1499962,"This research project is supported by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>In the last decade, there has been a tremendous increase in the use of video for preparing teachers and studying teaching quality. Prominent approaches to summative evaluation of teaching candidates and beginning teachers feature video recordings of instructional practices. In addition, large-scale research studies have included video of instruction. Teacher preparation programs increasingly use video in methods courses and for formative assessment purposes. Moreover, the growing use of interactive simulation in pre-service preparation and in-service professional development relies on having video recorded examples of exemplary instructional practices. Despite the significant growth in the use of video to measure and promote instructional quality in recent years, there remain some key challenges to employing it at scale. First, it is very time-consuming for trained human raters to view hundreds of hours of video recorded lessons. Second, financial costs and time demands increase with the use of multiple human raters per video. Third, manually cataloging, labeling, and indexing large volumes of classroom video for later viewing is time consuming. Recent advances in computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning may provide solutions to these challenges and could make the process of analyzing and scoring videos more efficient. In particular, deep learning has become the state-of-the-art choice in problems related to analyzing the content of video. This proposed NSF Core Research study will draw on videos of elementary mathematics instruction that were collected for two NSF-funded studies that featured the Mathematics-Scan (M-Scan) classroom observation tool. The research will use these videos to explore several ways that deep neural networks can be used to classify instructional activities in videos of math instruction.<br/><br/>This study will advance knowledge and understanding by examining the degree to which three types of artificial neural networks can accurately classify (a) objects and (b) instructional activities in videos of elementary mathematics instruction. For example, it may be straightforward for neural networks to determine whether an elementary teacher is engaged in lecture vs. facilitating discussion with students. On the other hand, it may be harder for such networks to assess the ways teachers represent math content, the nature of their questions, and whether student gestures signify understanding. The research design concerns three aspects of using computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning: (a) the type of neural network, (b) the type of video label (i.e., object labels and instructional activity labels), and (c) the subject of math instruction (e.g., number and operations; patterns, functions, and algebra; geometry). A few types of neural networks have recently proven effective for video classification: convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, and hybrid CNN-LSTMs. Ultimately, this project is aimed at beginning to build systematic infrastructure for classifying videos of classroom instruction at scale in efficient and affordable ways. The findings will potentially have key implications for (a) large-scale research studies that feature videos of instruction and (b) pre-service teacher preparation programs, in-service professional development activities, and efforts to evaluate teaching candidates and practicing teachers. In particular, the results from this study will inform decisions about the types of neural networks that can be used to correctly classify videos of instruction and the practical limitations of using networks for this purpose.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wildfire is a key component of summer climate in the North Pacific where wildfires are projected to increase with continued summer warming. Studies that combine paleorecords of summer climate and wildfire are therefore critically needed, especially in the North Pacific region where fire recurrence rate and decadal-to-centennial scale climate fluctuations occur over longer time periods than are covered by direct observations. The goal of the proposed research is to improve our understanding of relationships between summertime climate and wildfire activity, focusing especially on the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), when regional temperatures were perhaps as warm as the 20th century. Recent advances now permit the measurement of new fire-related (pyrogenic) compounds in ice cores, enabling the development of a robust fire record capable of rigorous comparison with regional paleoclimate reconstructions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The records of summer atmospheric circulation developed through this project will be regionally unique and fill a critical gap in the suite of North Pacific paleoclimate records. The ice core fire records will have synchronously dated temperature, precipitation and circulation time series. Our unique compilation of these ice core records, as well as other regional paleoproxy records will be the first effort at combining these datasets into a regional compilation of paleofire records in the North Pacific region. This compilation will facilitate the examination of fire activity during Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) conditions that are of comparable magnitude to present climate changes over socially relevant timescales (decades). We will analyze the archive Denali ice core for black carbon, which is derived from both biomass and fossil fuel combustion, and organic aromatic acids (e.g. vanillic acid) and monosaccharide anhydride (e.g. levoglucosan) which are produced solely from biomass burning. The Denali ice core chronology is already developed, and the archive ice is in hand, ensuring that our research plan can be accomplished. Fire record synthesis and calibration will incorporate instrumental fire databases, gridded burn area data, and HYSPLIT back-trajectory analyses over the instrumental era in order to test the sensitivity of fireclimate relationships over time. With this record we will address the following research questions: (1) How have North Pacific summer atmospheric circulation patterns varied over the last 1500 years? (2) How did North Pacific fire regime characteristics naturally respond to the warm summer conditions of the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA)? (3) Are there consistent relationships between North Pacific fire regime and climate?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A focal point of our broader impacts is support for two young investigators who have specialized expertise in North Pacific ice cores and paleofire modeling, respectively. This project will also support one PhD student and several undergraduate students. We will continue our longstanding collaboration with Denali National Park to present and permanently display our major climate- and fire-related findings at the park visitor center in Talkeetna, Alaska. We are partnering with the Natural Sciences Education and Outreach Center at Colorado State University to develop STEM kits focused on the Denali ice core record for distribution to under-served K-12 students in Alaska and Maine. Prototypes of these kits have already been developed and tested with students, and we propose to significantly expand this program and increase its impact. Other activities include the participation of first-year women researchers in this project as part of the Dartmouth Women In Science Project (WISP) initiative, and through participation in the NSF-supported School of Ice, where faculty from historically black colleges and minority-serving institutions learn about ice cores and climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000092.xml,Excellence in Research: Designing biodegradable bottlebrush polymers based on their structure-property relationships for strong tissue adhesion and drug delivery,NSF,2020-07-15,2024-06-30,763457,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Biomedical adhesive polymers are nonmetallic materials which possess the ability to join two tissue surfaces together via bonding. Targeted tissues may include everything from hard tissues (bone, tooth, cartilage) to soft tissues (most other organs). The most common application of biomedical adhesives involves the replacement of conventional wound closures such as sutures and staples. Biomedical adhesives can be also used as hemostatic agents to stop bleeding, sealants to close large space gap between tissues, wound dressing to enhance healing, and drug delivery matrices to transport drugs efficiently and safely into the body. However, these existing biomedical adhesives products have significant limitations. These limitations include poor adhesion strength, limited tissue application, poor release over curing rate, applied tissues stiffening, and safety concerns surrounding their base materials, polymers. This project will develop a new, well-defined bottlebrush polymer that has strong adhesion to tissue, drug delivery capabilities, degradability, and biocompatibility. The proposed program will establish synthetic principles and structure-property relationships for multifunctional biomedical polymeric adhesives to overcome current limitations. This funding will also be used for the educational goal of developing a new participatory summer research program for HBCU undergraduate students. The program will allow students to acquire knowledge on basic research methods while studying polymeric adhesives at the PI’s lab. An additional collaborative summer research program, focused on underserved students, will provide state of the art research opportunities with other prestigious research groups at prominent institutes. <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/> <br/>Bottlebrush polymers contain dense polymer brush chains linked to a backbone. The densely populated polymer brushes form a three-dimensional cylindrical shape and can encompass an increased population of functionalities in a unit space compared to linear polymers. Because the bottlebrush polymer demonstrates unique bulk properties such as low entanglement, low modulus, and other unique viscoelastic properties (e.g., supersoft elastomer), the bottlebrush polymer has received considerable attention in the past decade. However, previous bottlebrush polymer research has paid less attention to adhesive properties due to synthetic challenges. These challenges include the preparation of well-defined polymer structures and the lack of interdisciplinary knowledge on sophisticated polymer synthesis and adhesion/viscoelastic property characterization. In particular, integration of two or more functional groups on a bottlebrush polymer while still maintaining strong adhesion remains a challenging issue. In this project, a new approach is proposed by using both controlled radical polymerization and ring opening polymerization to synthesize the bottlebrush main structure. Then, a terminal of the dense bottlebrush chains will be modified to form ester linkages to gallol (strong adhesion), Ertapenem (antibiotics), 5-Fu (anticancer agent), and Oxaliplatin (anticancer agent). The detailed structure-property relationships of the new bottlebrush biomedical adhesive will be determined through the variation of the segmental ratio of gallol/drug, total polymer molecular weight, and brush chain lengths. The following comprehensive property characterizations will be performed to complete the structure-property relationship study: adhesion tests (lap shear strength tests and uniaxial indentation tests), viscoelastic property (rheometer), modulus test (tensile tester), heat generation test (thermometer), drug release test, biocompatibility test, and degradability test. The outreach and educational goals of this proposal is to develop a new participatory educational research program for underrepresented groups in HBCU. The participants will conduct real-world biomaterials research with Chung research group at FAMU-FSU college of engineering and with other collaborating research groups at other prestigious universities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project provides summer research opportunities for undergraduate students of diverse backgrounds with special attention to females and members of underrepresented minorities.     <br/><br/>From a technical standpoint, the focus of this award is on molecular structure-conductance relationships in two mechanistic regimes, namely the quantum mechanical tunneling and the classical hopping limits. These very different transport mechanisms are defined by molecular structure, with the tunneling mechanism generally pertaining to molecules less than ~5 nm in length, and hopping persisting for molecules longer than this value, depending on bonding architecture. The principal investigator and his collaborators have shown that analytical theory called the single level model (SLM) accurately describes the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics for certain benchmark molecular junctions in the tunneling regime. In this project, the research team probe the generality of the SLM for describing molecular tunneling in a variety of systems with particular attention to the impact of intermolecular interactions and surface attachment chemistry. In the hopping regime, the emphasis is on understanding the precise nature of the intramolecular charge-transfer transition states in pi-conjugated oligomers, particularly the transition state energy (height of the free energy barrier) and the associated bond length and angle deformations. For this purpose, kinetic isotope analysis of hopping conduction is combined with quantum chemical calculations of the transition state.

2002658.xml,Investigation of the strange metal normal state of electron-doped oxide superconductors,NSF,2020-08-01,2024-07-31,480000,"Non-technical abstract<br/>Superconductivity, the complete absence of electrical resistance, is an amazing low temperature property of some elements and compounds.  This property of solids was discovered in 1911 and was believed to be fully understood in 1957 by the Bardeen, Cooper, Schrieffer (BCS) theory. In 1987 some copper oxide compounds (cuprates) were discovered with unexpectedly high superconducting transition temperatures (up to 140 Kelvin).  This high-temperature superconductivity cannot be explained by the conventional BCS mechanism and it is not presently understood. A complete understanding of high-temperature superconductivity is one of the major unsolved problems of condensed matter physics.  The solution to this problem could lead to the discovery of room temperature (300 Kelvin) superconductors, a development with very significant practical applications. This project performs experimental studies on one class of cuprate compounds where the superconductivity can be completely eliminated by the application of a small magnetic field. This enables the non-superconducting, or normal, metallic state to be studied over a wide range of temperature from 600 K to well below 1K. The normal state of the cuprates has quite different physical properties from those of well-known metals, such as copper or lead, and the cuprates have been called strange metals. An understanding of this strange metal state is believed to be crucial for an understanding of the origin of the superconductivity. In this project a variety of transport and other experiments are performed on specially prepared thin films.  Variation of the magnetic field, the temperature and electron doping can change the normal state properties in ways that are expected to give deep insight into the nature of the strange metal state and the superconductivity.  This project supports the education of PhD and undergraduate students at the University of Maryland---an urban university with a diverse population---in advanced vacuum deposition and electrical characterization techniques. These techniques have proven to be excellent training for productive scientific careers in academic and technology settings.<br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/>Understanding the mechanism of superconductivity and the non-Fermi liquid (strange metal) normal state in strongly correlated oxides is one of the most significant unsolved problems of condensed matter physics. Recently some dramatic experimental results have been reported by the PI (and others) that give new insights into the physics of the copper oxides (cuprates) and that also report the discovery of superconductivity in a related nickelate system, Sr doped NdNiO2. This project follows up on these breakthroughs to gain a more detailed understanding of the strange normal state of the electron-doped cuprates and the doped nickelates. This project provides a comprehensive set of experiments to study the nature of the normal state when superconductivity is suppressed, either by magnetic field, disorder or critical current. The electron-doped cuprates are particularly advantageous for this research because the low temperature normal state (0< T< Tc) can be reached with a modest dc magnetic field (H < 10 T). An understanding of the nature of the normal state of the cuprates is believed to be crucial for understanding the cause of high-temperature superconductivity in the cuprates. The experimental techniques used are resistivity, Hall Effect, magnetoresistance, Nernst effect, thermopower, specific heat and strain (pressure). Some transport experiments are done at very high magnetic field at the NSF supported National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) in Tallahassee and Los Alamos. The research includes an in-depth study of the itinerant ferromagnetism discovered by the PI in 2019 in the highly doped region of the n-type cuprates  The combination of materials science expertise and physics measurement expertise of the PI is essential for making progress in this very important area of correlated physics materials research. This project incorporates the training of high-school students, undergraduate science majors, graduate students, and postdoctoral scientists in various experimental aspects of condensed matter physics research. As in the past, the principal investigator will encourage women and underrepresented groups to participate in this project. The external collaborations in this project provide a unique vehicle for students to experience research in different laboratory environments, i.e., university, industry, and government.

However, current HTL processes produce a large amount of wastewater containing high concentrations of organic compounds and nutrients; the sustainable disposal of this wastewater is one of the most significant bottlenecks to the scale-up and commercialization of HTL. This research will address concerns from both environmental and energy conversion efficiency perspectives of HTL by recovering organic carbon and nutrients from HTL wastewater. This is a critical step to increasing the net energy yield and enhancing the economic viability and environmental sustainability of HTL processes. In the course of carrying out this project, the researchers will train the next generation of scientists and engineers in biofuel production, biotechnology/bioprocessing, and environmental stewardship, all while educating the public about sustainable biofuel production and the impact of energy consumption on economic, environmental and societal sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team of this proposal has recently found that a marine protist Thraustochytrium striatum HB can survive and grow in wastewater produced from HTL processing of municipal solid waste without supplemental nutrients while removing approximately 80% total organic carbon, 100% total nitrogen, and 80% phosphorus. Additionally, the microbes were found to be tolerant of wide pH and salinity ranges (comparable to sea water) in metabolizing organic compounds in HTL wastewater while being able to form cell aggregates under harsh conditions. Therefore, marine protists hold promise to be a new class of superior microorganisms for HTL wastewater treatment and valorization. The overarching goal of this project is to establish a T. striatum HB-facilitated platform for HTL wastewater valorization to enable sustainable HTL for biofuel production. The specific objectives of this research are to: (1) elucidate the correlation between biocrude yield and the HTL wastewater composition; (2) reveal the metabolic adaptation of T. striatum HB to the new wastewater environments to enhance overall energy return and biocrude yield; and (3) explore the formation mechanisms of T. striatum HB biogranules and the resulting performance impact on HTL wastewater valorization since biogranules are more efficient in wastewater valorization compared to dispersed cells. The marine protists could be a new class of promising microorganisms for valorization of other types of high-strength wastewater. The interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research will facilitate the integration of research and educational plans to enhance the education programs of three institutes involved in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001224.xml,"Derived Categories, Noncommutative Orders, and Other Topics",NSF,2020-07-01,2024-06-30,239008,"The proposed research is in the field of algebraic geometry with some connections to string theory. Algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics studying geometric objects defined by polynomial equations and related mathematical structures. Classically one associates with such geometric objects (called algebraic varieties) the set of algebraic functions on them which forms a commutative ring (i.e., functions can be added and multiplied). Modern research involves more sophisticated algebraic structures associated with algebraic varieties, such as the category of coherent sheaves (the notion of a category is a generalization of that of an associative ring). One part of the project is to establish some cases of the homological mirror symmetry conjecture which identifies categories appearing in geometry in two seemingly unrelated contexts. Another part of the project aims to give a rigorous mathematical foundation to some aspects of the use of super Riemann surfaces (a generalization of the usual surfaces) in string theory. This project provides research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>More specifically, the first part of the project is on homological mirror symmetry for symmetric powers of punctured spheres. The goal is to identify categorical resolutions of derived categories of coherent sheaves on certain algebraic varieties with partially wrapped Fukaya categories of the symmetric powers of punctured spheres. This may help to find a new construction of Ozsvath-Szabo's categorical knot invariant. The second part is to work out a generalization of the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch formula to the categories of matrix factorizations over non-affine varieties and stacks. The PI also would like to use categories of matrix factorizations to find a Landau-Ginzburg counterpart of the G-equivariant Gromov-Witten theory. The third part of the project is to realize trigonometric solutions of the associative Yang-Baxter equation in terms of noncommutative orders over nodal cubics. The fourth part is related to the geometry of stable supercurves. The PI proposes to understand the poles of the analog of Mumford's isomorphism for the Berezinian of the moduli of supercurves near the boundary of the compactification by stable supercurves and to study some problems arising in integration over the moduli space of supercurves.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The long-term perspective of central MSEA variability from the proxy records will be synthesized with the simulations for a more dynamically-based understanding of past and future changes in atmospheric and upper-ocean properties throughout Southeast Asia and the Maritime Continent.<br/><br/>Specifically, the research team aims to use measurements of early and late wood width and density from blue light intensity in tree ring samples to reconstruct seasonal to multi-decadal records of the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), rainfall, and boreal winter maximum temperature over the past five to ten centuries. Links between central MSEA and Indo-Pacific atmospheric and surface ocean properties over the past centuries will be evaluated using observational/reanalysis products and coupled climate model simulations because model resolution may not fully capture climate and ocean variability within individual monsoon seasons.<br/><br/>The Asian Monsoon impacts roughly two-thirds of the global population. Multi-model assessments of regional climate under anthropogenic warming predict changes to the Asian Monsoon that are expected to impact regional climate and ocean variability.  These multi-model assessments also predict a transition to a more El Nino-like state, which is expected to variably alter precipitation, temperature and ocean circulation patterns globally.  The present understanding of past changes in monsoon strength and precipitation and the resulting consequences for Indian Ocean surface variability limits climatologist’s ability to accurately forecast regional climate impacts at various timescales.<br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts (B.I.) include better understanding of variability and long-term trends in rainfall and drought from Southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific region. Such information has important implications for surrounding countries whose largely agrarian societies depend on reliable monsoon rainfall.  The project also supports a new investigator and student participation in Woods Hole and UCAR SOARS summer programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001018.xml,I-Corps: A Mobile-Based Opioid Overdose Alerting System,NSF,2020-02-15,2020-12-31,50000,"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop a smart wearable monitor capable of delivering clinical-grade measurements of lung function (e.g., tidal volume, forced expiratory volume, minute ventilation, etc.).  However, while suitable for in-hospital care, the current solutions present drawbacks in the delivery of telecare and self-management. The value proposition of this project is to present a non-invasive continuous pulmonary function monitor for persons with an acute or chronic respiratory illness to self-manage, monitor, or prevent exacerbations of their illness. This monitor would be implemented as a stretchable, wearable sensor that estimates changes in the size of the ribcage from breathing.  The development of such a technology has significant potential for reducing fatal opioid overdoses, asthma- and COPD-related emergency department visits, and support pulmonary rehabilitation delivered via telemedicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project aims to explore the commercial potential for a wireless single-band stretchable silicone sensor, which when worn around the chest is capable of measuring tidal volume from which other measures of lung function can be derived (e.g., forced expiratory volume, minute ventilation, etc.). Currently, lung function testing, spirometry, capnometry, respiratory inductance plethysmography, and pulse oximetry are the clinical standard for vital monitoring and assessing lung function. Until now, respiratory inductance plethysmography monitors, which requires two bands – a chest-worn and abdomen worn band, is the least invasive technology for tidal volume monitoring. Pulse oximetry is an inferior technology for the early detection of respiratory distress (or colloquially, shortness of breath) because changes in oxygenation take time. In contrast, for example, respiratory depression can be quickly detected by changes in tidal volume. However, capnography and respiratory inductance plethysmography monitors, which are capable of monitoring tidal volume, are cumbersome and ill-suited for use outside a clinical setting.New evidence has now demonstrated that by measuring the change in circumference of the ribcage, you can estimate tidal volume with high fidelity using a stretchable sensor capable of confirming to the body. Integrating this sensor technology into a wearable device with a wireless sensor module has the potential to unlock new avenues for telehealth monitoring and delivery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001490.xml,Collaborative Research to Explore the Spatial/Temporal Statistical-Physical Structures of Rain in the Vertical Plane,NSF,2020-04-01,2024-12-31,399196,"A good understanding of rain in time and space is important for improved public safety and productivity. With regard to public safety, this means better water control designs for reducing the impact of flooding from smaller urban to larger regional scales as well as for improved spatial and temporal warnings of flooding in order to reduce damage and fatalities. With regard to productivity in rural areas, such information has the potential for reducing the impacts of soil erosion through the better design of field run-off and water storage. In more urban areas, productivity depends in part upon good wireless communication. However, the advent of 5G wireless networks will be more subject to signal loss due to rain, a loss that also depends upon the largely unknown spatial structure of rainfall particularly above the ground. All of these improvements, however, depend upon the proper translation of radar measurements and numerical model outputs to many different scales. This in turn requires that radar measurements above the ground as well as numerical model products be correctly transferred to what appears at the surface where people live. This, then, is a central objective of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically with regard to the science, this project allows a more complete description of rain structure in a multi-dimensional context including height with the additional benefit of developing a better multi-dimensional understanding of drop interactions and evolution. Furthermore, the project is directed toward a more comprehensive investigation into the prevalence and the importance of statistical homogeneity in all three spatial dimensions as well as in time. Statistical homogeneity is important for the proper scaling of rainfall measurements, but, of course, not all rain is statistically homogeneous. However, it often appears that when the data are statistically heterogeneous, such data may be subdivided into statistically homogeneous sections which can then be properly treated analytically. This project develops this approach. In addition, wind tower measurements as well as simultaneous measurements between two 2DVD disdrometers will be used to explore further the reported deviations of drop fall speeds from their nominal terminal values both aloft and at the surface. This is potentially quite important for the proper understanding of the evolution of rain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Meanwhile, GPGPUs are also quickly becoming an essential part of data centers around the globe. The number of data centers are growing drastically due to the recent explosion of social networking, movie streaming, online shopping, big data, internet of things, etc.  With hundreds or thousands of cores running in each GPGPU, severe heating is a serious challenge which   can significantly degrade GPGPU performance, reliability and energy efficiency unless effective cooling is employed.  However, effective cooling of data centers requires enormous expenditure of energy.  To ease all these problems, effective thermal management and thermal-aware task scheduling for GPGPU operation are needed, which however requires an accurate simulation tool that is able to offer efficient dynamic thermal prediction with a reasonable spatial resolution.   Currently, there is a lack of thermal simulation tools that offer high efficiency and accuracy with a reasonable resolution. The proposed work aims to develop an efficient simulation methodology based on a reduced learning algorithm that is capable of predicting accurate dynamic temperature distributions with a high resolution in GPGPUs.  With this novel approach implemented in GPGPUs, effective thermal management and task scheduling will become possible and will improve GPGPU performance and reliability.  This will also improve energy savings in cooling, computing and streaming and minimize the earth’s environmental stress.  This project will also contribute to interdisciplinary workforce training and prepare students for the emerging challenge of heating problems in GPGPU computing. Research related to the proposed work will be integrated into several courses taught by the PIs. Course projects will be developed by the Ph.D. and undergraduate students working on the proposed work. This will offer undergraduate and graduate students a useful learning experience beyond the textbooks and lectures. The PIs will also expand and integrate several ongoing activities to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in STEM, e.g. through the Co-PI's NSF REU site. A special effort will be made to recruit and mentor Native Americans from an Indian Reservation near the PI’s university to join STEM activities and to pursue their careers in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop a multi-block simulation methodology for efficient, accurate prediction of dynamic thermal profiles of GPGPUs derived from a reduced learning algorithm. To reduce simulation space and thus the computational time while maintaining accurate thermal solution, the domain structure of a GPGPU is projected onto a functional space described by a set of basis functions obtained from the reduced learning method.  This projection learning process however requires collection of massive amounts of thermal data for the entire GPGPU and is computationally prohibitive. Domain decomposition is therefore applied to partition the GPGPU domain into hundreds of smaller generic building blocks. This building-block approach enables more efficient training of the basis functions to develop the multi-block thermal model.  This methodology offers a reduction in the computational time by several orders of magnitude for thermal simulation of semiconductor chips, compared with the direct numerical simulation.  Currently, thermal simulations of GPGPUs rely on the efficient compact resistance-capacitance (RC) thermal model that provides poor resolution and inaccurate thermal profiles. It is expected that the developed thermal simulation model will be even more efficient than the compact RC model.  Also, the multi-block approach possesses a natural advantage of effective parallel computing. This project will implement the developed multi-block model in hundreds of cores in a GPGPU to perform parallel GPGPU computing that will further speed up the thermal simulation of GPGPUs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to extract useful information and fully achieve the potential of IoT for intelligent decisions, it is critical to develop novel systems to efficiently transmit, store and process this large volume of data. Fortunately, the data generated by IoT and many other applications typically possesses certain low dimensional parsimonious structures. Leveraging on these low dimensional structures of IoT data, this project will develop methods based on low dimensional sketches to infer information of interest. This sketching based framework will enable quick and accurate information extraction with greatly reduced sampling rates, transmission and storage costs.<br/><br/>This project will develop a sketching based framework for the efficient processing of high dimensional data generated by IoT and investigate its theoretical and algorithmic properties. The core idea is to take low dimensional projections or sketches of random variables, rather than to directly and fully observe high dimensional random variables. This project will develop both non-adaptive and adaptive low dimensional sketching methods, and will make the following intellectual contributions: 1) deriving fundamental limits on sampling rates for recovering statistical information of high dimensional random variables; 2) designing explicit sampling schemes that achieve the corresponding fundamental limits on sampling rates; 3) providing fast algorithms with performance guarantees for recovering statistical information from sketches of random variables.

In practice, the difficulty in applying learning algorithms in communication systems comes from a paradigm shift in the methodology: From conventional model-based analytical solutions to data-driven empirical-result-based approaches. While learning algorithms offer better flexibility and efficiency in using computational resources, the lack of guarantees in the performance, robustness and security raise issues when adopting into engineering designs.

2001799.xml,Lianas as a Keystone Guild in Tropical Forests: An Experimental Test,NSF,2020-07-01,2025-06-30,915000,"Why is species diversity so remarkably high in tropical forests? Why don’t dominant competitors displace subordinate competitors, and thus, lower species diversity? These seemingly simple questions are critical for understanding how ecosystems function. Despite being core questions in the field of ecology, they remain unresolved. One promising explanation for the maintenance of tropical forest diversity is that there are guilds of important “keystone” species that maintain diversity by preventing the best competitor species from displacing subordinate competitor species. However, the keystone guild hypothesis has never been tested in tropical forests. In this study, the PI and collaborators will evaluate the keystone guild hypothesis as an explanation for the maintenance of the extraordinary tree species diversity in tropical forests. They will test the prediction that lianas (woody vines), which have a particularly strong negative effect on dominant tree species, prevent those dominant trees from displacing subordinate ones. They will utilize an ongoing, large-scale, long-term liana-exclusion experiment that the PI began in 2008. Species diversity affects ecosystem function, and therefore human and global health. Thus, this research will inform management decisions and ecosystem function in a highly diverse tropical forest. This study will also allow the PI to actively mentor promising students from groups that are underrepresented in science.<br/><br/>The Keystone Species Concept (KSC) is a foundational theory to explain the maintenance of species diversity. The KSC has been tested primarily for predators in simplified marine communities; few studies have extended this concept beyond a single keystone species and beyond relatively simple communities. By expanding the KSC to include guilds, or groups of organisms with convergent life-history strategies, the KSC may be a powerful explanation for the maintenance of species diversity in many ecosystems. The PI will test the hypothesis that lianas are a keystone guild for the tropical tree community. Lianas compete intensely with trees, and recent evidence suggests that they suppress shade-tolerant tree populations more than shade-intolerant tree populations. By removing lianas, the established competitive balance among tree species (when lianas are present) may be altered, allowing the competitive dominant species to displace subordinate species and ultimately reducing tree community diversity. By comparing the change in tree species richness, diversity, and composition in the liana-removal and control plots (where lianas are present), the PI can, for the first time, determine whether lianas are a keystone guild that maintains tree species diversity in tropical forests.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Continental hotspot eruptions are the soures of the largest documented eruptions on Earth.   Hotspot magmatism is recognized in part on identification of a linear chain of volcanoes that becomes younger opposite the direction of plate motion. These age-progressions may be unclear when volcanism along a hotspot “track” does not temporally fit in the age progression and is therefore, out of sequence and at times, off-axis.  The Snake River Plain-Yellowstone (SRPY) volcanic province (Wyoming-Montana-Idaho, including Yellowstone National Park) is the classic example of continental hotspot magmatism, and major SRPY “supervolcano” eruptions are well documented.  Small-volume volcanoes exist adjacent to the SRPY, however.  This project will investigate these out of sequence volcanoes to provide an analog to better identify hotspots in the geological record, yield new constraints on how the Yellowstone hotspot interacts with North America, and be used to help refine models for the origin and eruptive history of volcanism associated with this hotspot.  The findings have implications for continental hotspot volcanic hazard assessments. Student training and public outreach are also key aspects of this project.<br/><br/>A multidisciplinary approach will be employed to unravel the spatial-temporal magmatic history adjacent to the youngest part of the SRPY hotspot track, including field mapping focused on the relations between structures and igneous activity, geochronology, and geochemistry. These data will allow the research team to: [1] determine the temporal-spatial history of out-of-sequence volcanism adjacent to the SRPY; [2] define the mantle and crustal contributions to this out of sequence and off-axis volcanism; [3] decipher the links between syn-magmatic extension, SRPY magmatism and the out of sequence and off-axis volcanism. The proposed study will provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to learn a diverse suite of field, presentation, and laboratory skills.

These delicate ecosystems are being impacted by unprecedented human population increases in the region, resulting in changes to land use such as increased infrastructure and recreational activities. These ecosystems are also in peril from the warming and drying trend in Western North America, which is causing a rise in wild fire risk. To mitigate the negative impacts of these changes, awareness of invertebrate species distributions and biodiversity is needed to help make informed land management and conservation policies. The University of Colorado Museum of Natural History (UCM) Invertebrate Zoology collection documents 120 years of Colorado Rocky Mountains and Great Plains changing ecosystem. This project will allow researchers, educators and the public to freely access specimen data from this collection, through digitization and upload of the collection’s data to web based portals including InvertEBase and iDigBio. These specimen data will include taxonomic and geographic coverage of North American non-insect invertebrate species, with an emphasis on snails, crayfish, sponges, leeches and earthworms. Undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Colorado will be trained in data management, museum curation and best practices. The project will develop activities for a middle school summer camp program. Activities will be designed to promote scientific literacy, and will mainly serve historically underrepresented groups in STEM. <br/><br/>By partnering with the existing Thematic Collections Network (TCN) InvertEBase, this project will extend the available data for invertebrate species’ geographic ranges and biodiversity in North America for researchers, land managers and the general public. For the first time, UCM specimen records will be electronically accessible for over 43,000 lots of invertebrates from the Colorado Rocky Mountains and Great Plains. High resolution stacked digital images of over 1,000 exemplar specimens will be taken and shared, and will include 277 primary type specimens. Approximately 150 historic microscope slides from the collection will be imaged with a scanning microscope to produce research quality images of important diagnostic features from a variety of taxa. Finally, 8,000 gastropod snail records from the Rocky Mountains and Great Plains will be georeferenced to allow advancement in scientific and public understanding of the distribution of this group, and how elevation and climate influence their distribution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002840.xml,Collaborative Research: Physical Mechanism of Melt Pool Oscillation and Spatter Formation in Laser Powder Bed Fusion Additive Manufacturing,NSF,2019-10-01,2023-09-30,286971,"Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is a widely used additive manufacturing process that can 3D print complex metallic components that can not be produced by conventional manufacturing technologies. Spattering, the uncontrolled eruption of metal droplets, is a critical problem in LPBF systems and is a major cause of poor quality in components printed using the process. In spite of this, the fundamental reasons for spatter formation are not well understood and effective approaches for reducing spatter in LPBF are not available. This award supports fundamental research to understand spatter formation. The research team will perform experiments and computer simulations to observe the dynamic process of spatter formation and model the behavior of the molten metal pool to reveal the spatter formation mechanisms. The outcomes of the research will provide important guidance for optimizing the LPBF process to produce defect-free 3D printed metal parts. This will significantly expedite the applications of 3D printing in aerospace, biomedical, automotive, and other industries and will strengthen the manufacturing capability and competitiveness of U.S. industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spatter formation in LPBF is a highly transient process with complex coupling of multi-physics. Due to a limited ability to observe and measure the controlling parameters with adequate spatial and temporal resolution, there is a lack of understanding of the fundamental physics of spatter formation in LPBF. The objectives of this research are to: (i) test the hypothesis that the spatter formation is caused by melt pool oscillation, (ii) test the hypothesis that melt pool oscillation is caused by three physics mechanisms (i.e., non-uniform laser absorption, random powder blocking, and random powder merging), and (iii) evaluate the significance of the three hypothetical mechanisms to melt pool oscillation and spatter formation. A synergistic experimental and numerical investigation will be performed to achieve the research objectives. On the experimental side, a novel two-view high-speed imaging system, including synchrotron-based, side-view, X-ray imaging and a visible-light camera at 45 degrees to the horizontal direction will be used to provide 3-dimensional information on the dynamic behavior of the powder particles, melt pool, depression zone, and spatters. On the numerical side, a multi-physics model will be established to simulate the laser-matter interaction, multi-phase thermofluidic flow, dynamic surface motion, and fluid-solid interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Polymer glasses are used in applications as diverse as advanced aircraft composites and eyeglass lenses. The planned research will investigate how polymer glasses respond when they are subjected to large forces. In particular, the experiments will use lasers and microscopes to measure how the polymer molecules rearrange when a polymer glass is deformed. Current theories and computer simulations have identified this molecular motion as a key quantity that must be understood to determine if a polymer glass will stretch, deform, or break. The polymer glasses to be used will be processed in special ways (stretched at high temperature or deformed at low temperature) to critically test these simulations and theories. The proposed experiments should lead to more reliable models for the prediction of the mechanical properties of polymer glasses.  This in turn may have a significant economic impact because of the broad potential of these lightweight materials.  The students involved in this project will learn how to characterize polymer glasses and improve the properties of materials. All personnel supported by this grant will participate in a program to increase the number of highly qualified students from underrepresented groups that enter Ph.D. programs in the U.S.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The deformation properties of polymer glasses are extremely challenging to predict as a result of the nonlinear nature of the deformation and the nonequilibrium nature of the glass. Here it is proposed to measure segmental mobility in polymer glasses during deformation using an optical photobleaching method that provides access to the rotational correlation function of an ensemble of dilute probe molecules.  Deformation can increase segmental mobility in polymer glasses by more than a factor of 1000, and an understanding of this enhanced mobility is a key requirement for accurate modeling of the mechanical properties of polymer glasses. For the proposed work, polymer glasses will be prepared by melt quenching so that subsequent mobility measurements during deformation can disentangle the influences of yield and strain hardening on segmental mobility. The proposed work will also test whether deformed polymer glasses can show indications of overaging, i.e., physical aging that occurs at an accelerated rate as a result of applied stress.  Finally, the generality of the results obtained in tensile deformation will be tested by performing optical measurements of segmental mobility during shear deformation. The proposed experiments can provide a molecular-level test of theoretical descriptions of polymer glass deformation. The experimental results obtained, in comparison with theory and simulation, should lead to an enhanced fundamental understanding of the deformation of polymer glasses. All personnel supported by this grant will participate in a program to increase the number of highly qualified students from underrepresented groups that enter Ph.D. programs in the U.S.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The high cost and scarcity of lithium and transition metal (Cobalt) resources has become a bottleneck for the development of Li-ion batteries for these larger capacity applications of energy storage and transport propulsion. Developing efficient lithium-free and transition metal-free battery technology with affordable and sustainable resources is an important research topic for advanced energy storage. This project explores battery systems beyond Li-ion batteries with emphasis on sodium-ion batteries and other potential high energy chemistries based upon magnesium (Mg) and aluminum (Al). A key enabling factor of this project is the implementation of lightweight, abundant, inexpensive, sustainable, and recyclable metal-free organic/polymer materials as promising cathodes for Na/Mg/Al batteries. Innovative structure design and facile fabrication approaches will be studied to enable the high energy, fast charge, and long lifetime batteries. Research activities will involve the training of graduate students, undergraduate researchers, and high school students, and will promote gifted minority students into the energy science ranks. A key goal of this project is to integrate research and education of high school, undergraduate, M.S. and Ph.D. students. The combined research and educational activities will provide a strong platform to train students with computational and hands-on skills in material science, chemistry, and energy science fields.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to seek fundamental understanding of the material structure -electrochemical performance relationships in Na-ion and multivalent metal (Mg/Al) batteries at the molecular and device levels. This project integrates multidisciplinary research, education, and outreach for sustainable energy storage beyond Li-ion batteries. Novel organic materials and polymers will be designed and synthesized with multi-functional reaction centers in one molecular unit to enhance the battery energy capacity. Extensive structural characterizations including in situ X-ray diffractometry, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and pair distribution function analysis, will be performed to understand how the structure of organic/polymer materials determines the cation insertion/extraction mechanism and kinetics. The knowledge gained in these studies will be used to design and fabricate new organic/polymer materials to optimize the battery performance. These novel structures will significantly enhance the utilization, reaction kinetics, and stability of organic/polymer materials during charge/discharge cycles, thus improving overall energy density, power density, and cycle life. The investigation of organic/polymer materials will also include the investigation of ultralow temperature organic batteries to extend the applications of these sustainable energy storage devices in extremely cold areas such as South/North poles, and outer space.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000617.xml,Let's do science! Promoting the development of beneficial beliefs about science in early childhood,NSF,2020-05-01,2024-04-30,1514274,"The roots of gender, racial, and ethnic disparities in science achievement take hold in early childhood, with lifelong implications for educational outcomes. Often, these early roots are in the form of problematic beliefs, including beliefs that science is something in which only a select group of people can succeed. These beliefs are particularly discouraging for children from social groups that are underrepresented in science, including girls and children from certain racial and ethnic minority groups. This project will reveal how these problematic beliefs develop and how to promote more beneficial ones—in particular, how to promote beliefs that science is something that people learn to do rather than an identity that one needs to have. Further, this project will test whether targeting these beliefs in early childhood creates positive trajectories of science engagement over children’s transition from prekindergarten into formal schooling. In doing so, this project will develop a new approach to spreading beneficial beliefs about science and promoting science engagement among young children from social groups that are underrepresented in science, while addressing fundamental questions about how beliefs develop and spread across communities. By partnering with teachers to implement this project and using an innovative, webcam-based lab for remote developmental research, this project will maximize the opportunities for this research to lead to rapid changes in educational practices that will broaden participation in science in early childhood. This project is funded by the EHR Core Research program, which emphasizes STEM education research that will generate foundational knowledge in the field.<br/><br/>Phase 1 will reveal the mechanisms by which problematic or beneficial beliefs about science arise in early childhood via an experimental field study with 2,000 children and 200 teachers in a large, public prekindergarten program. This field experiment will test a model of conceptual development and belief transmission wherein children’s beliefs are shaped by subtle features of the language they hear about science; in particular, teachers’ use of linguistic cues implying that scientists are a special kind of person, including category labels (e.g., “Let’s be scientists!”) and generic descriptions of what scientists do or are like (e.g., “Scientists discover things about the world”). The field experiment will test the influence of reducing these identity-focused linguistic cues, and instead encourage more action-oriented language (e.g., “Let’s do science! Doing science leads to discovering things about the world”) on the development of children’s science beliefs and behavior. Phase 2 will examine the extent to which children’s developing beliefs about whether success in science requires a special identity have consequences for the development of social stereotypes about science and for children’s science engagement and efficacy over the transition to kindergarten (as social disparities in science interest and social stereotypes about scientists begin to emerge). This phase will entail a two-year longitudinal follow-up study of a subset of 500 children from the field experiment, which will be conducted via an innovative webcam-based lab for remote developmental research, which will allow for longitudinal tracking after children transition schools. Thus, this project will advance research by addressing fundamental questions about the nature of early conceptual and social development, including how language shapes the development of children’s science beliefs and behavior, how children’s beliefs change over time, and how researchers and educators can harness developmental mechanisms to promote positive developmental trajectories of science engagement across diverse populations of children. Creation of a public website to share project materials and findings will enable rapid dissemination to researchers across disciplines, curriculum developers, prekindergarten teachers, and families of young children.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000191.xml,Analysis of Properties of Effective Hamiltonians with Applications,NSF,2020-07-01,2025-06-30,302742,"Many physical systems (e.g. composite materials and turbulent combustion) in practical applications involve small structures. It is important to “average” those small scales through suitable mathematical models (called “homogenization”) and investigate resulting macroscopic structures (“effective quantities”) that are approximations of original systems. A particularly interesting and physically relevant question is to understand how those effective quantities depend on original physical systems. Effective Hamiltonian arises from homogenizing Hamilton-Jacobi equations, which are partial differential equations (PDE) that play fundamental roles in control theory and the modeling of things like crystal growth, flame propagations, etc. For example, effective Hamiltonian serves as an important approach to model turbulent flame speed, one of the most important quantities in turbulent combustion (e.g., the spread of wild fire fanned by strong wind, the burning inside an engine), via the popular G-equation model. One goal of this project is to understand how the turbulent flame speed depends on the strength of the flow (e.g., wind velocity) and other important physical quantities like curvature effects, which could provide theoretical justifications for phenomena observed in experiments. The curvature effect is a phenomenological way to capture variance of burning temperature along the flame front. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The first part of the project aims to identify optimal convergence rate in periodic homogenization of Hamilton-Jacobi equations. As the principal investigator and his collaborators have revealed in previous works, the optimal convergence rate is closely related to the shape of corresponding effective Hamiltonian. The second and third part of the project focus on studying important properties of effective Hamiltonian from perspectives of both the mathematical interest and practical applications in turbulent combustion. Although the existence of effect Hamiltonian has been established in many situations since the fundamental work of Lions-Papanicolaou-Varadhan (1987), understanding finer properties of effective Hamiltonian remains a major open problem in homogenization theory due to limitations of standard methods in PDEs. There are deep connections between properties of effective Hamiltonian and dynamical systems. In particular, the principal investigator needs to employ substantial tools/methods from ergodic theory, Aubry-Mather theory/weak KAM theory. In addition, dynamics associated with two-person zero-sum differential games is also important in dealing with non-convex Hamiltonian and the presence of curvature term (curvature effect).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Langlands program in modern mathematics has been evolving with deeper ideas since its inception. This workshop will provide an overview of recent rapid progress in the relative Langlands program and foster further development by encouraging interactions between senior and junior researchers. Given the recent exciting developments, a workshop on the subject is timely and will encourage young people to enter this very active field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Langlands's principle of functoriality and the automorphic L-functions are two central themes of the Langlands program and the theory of automorphic forms. Despite more than forty years of progress and numerous breakthroughs, many questions in this program are still open and even deeper questions have arisen. The theory of endoscopy, a special but very important case of functoriality, attracted immense efforts in the past thirty years, leading to breakthroughs such as the proof of the Fundamental Lemma and the endoscopic classification of automorphic representations of classical groups. Going beyond these remarkable achievements requires new techniques and ideas. In recent years, exciting new ideas have emerged, which have the potential to renew our vision of the whole subject. The conference will focus on three main topics: (1) the relative Langlands program, (2) relations between special values of (higher) derivatives of L-functions, and (3) beyond endoscopy and possible new cases of functoriality.

These polymers (large molecules containing many monomer units linked together with chemical bonds) are targeted as alternatives to petrochemically-derived plastics and as new families of biodegradable materials for biomedical applications.  The central focus is on the design and characterization of environmentally-benign, metal-free catalysts that enable optimum polymer production under large scale industrial conditions.  Functional properties such as degradability and biocompatibility of the polymers generated using these methods are also investigated.  The project effectively fosters academic and industrial collaboration on both scientific research and training of students.  The collaboration improves academic-industrial interactions, which can have a very positive educational impact on students and young researchers who are rarely educated about the ways to efficiently transfer laboratory-generated knowledge into the industrial realm.  This project has the potential to advance new strategies in polymer synthesis and create new technologies for the next generation of renewable plastics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The academic-industrial team of Waymouth and Hedrick develops new automated continuous flow reactors designed to function optimally under a variety of polymerization conditions.  They design new catalyst families based on squaramides and indole carboxamides and related structures.  The team invents “catalyst switch” strategies relying on rate differences associated with proton transfer to enable the scalable and reproducible generation of block copolymer libraries in ring-opening polymerization of polyesters and polycarbonates.  They also integrate catalytic strategies for both the synthesis of functional monomers and the macromolecules resulting from their enchainment.  Emphasis is placed on detailed mechanistic and theoretical investigations to illuminate the mechanistic details of organocatalytic polymerization reactions.  Degradation pathways associated with bio-mimicking poly(alpha-amino esters) in aqueous media are also investigated.

The purpose of this workshop is to bring together experts in engineering, community relations, and ethics to define a framework for community engagement in engineering research. Workshop participants will examine the recent history and practice of engagement in communities by engineering researchers with a focus on effective and ethical research collaboration. The outcome of this workshop will be a new framework for the practice of community-engaged research. Through these efforts, the workshop contributes to the advancement of STEM research in service of the American public. To maximize policy impact, the workshop will be held in Washington, DC.

The ESB region is densely populated, with 47% of the U.S. population expected to inhabit the counties adjacent to the shoreline by 2021. Habitat loss, pollution, overfishing, and climate change threaten commercially and ecologically important marine species all along the ESB. This project will make occurrence data with map coordinates available for over 3,000 species of mollusks that find their habitat along the ESB, including mussels, clams, conchs, snails, and squid. Data from these ecologically and commercially important species (over 4.5 million individual specimens) will be made available through public online data portals. While the geographic ranges for many species of mollusks are well-known, the extent of their distribution within the seafloor habitats they occupy is unknown. Adding map coordinates to occurrence records for live-collected mollusks in natural history collections will provide detailed knowledge of distributions. Because natural history collections have specimens collected from the mid-1800s to present, these occurrence records can help track distributional changes over time and lead to better fisheries and conservation management.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One hundred million mollusk specimens have been documented in natural history collections across North America, and the breadth, depth, and growth of these collections is exceptionally well-known compared to other invertebrate taxa. Mollusks are among the best sampled group of animals, with some species having over 2,000 digital records available in natural history collections making them extremely well-suited for environmental and biogeographical studies that track faunal change over time and space. However, already-digitized mollusk lots are missing essential data such as collecting date (30% of records) and reliable georeferences (85% of records). This project will generate reliable geo-coordinate data for all covered specimen lots using a collaborative georeferencing project in GeoLocate.  GeoLocate will add layers for bathymetric data, benthic habitat, and marine conservation areas. Incorporating bathymetry into GeoLocate to determine the extent of locations will also provide that capability for complex elevational data for terrestrial species. Important trait data will also be incorporated. For the first time, molluscan occurrence data will distinguish between live- and dead-collected specimens, with a defined vocabulary for traits added to each record. Due to the long persistence of molluscan shells, the live/dead- collected distinction is crucial for all studies of biotic change using mollusks. Information on collecting dates will be refined where possible to increase resolution for detecting biotic changes.

In pursuing this goal, the project will investigate mechanisms to trade the accuracy of communication data bits with the energy efficiency of wireline links and analyze how to do this trade-off dynamically. The research is motivated by the fact that emerging data applications such as recognition, mining, search, data analytics, and machine learning are naturally resilient and can still produce correct output in the presence of erroneous data. The concept of approximate computing has leveraged this very resilient nature of data applications to improve the efficiency of computing. This project will leverage the same resilient nature to improve the energy efficiency of wireline data links by doing approximate communication. The results of this research will open a new dimension for improving energy efficiency by trading communication data-bit accuracy with energy efficiency. The research outcomes will give software developers a control knob with which energy-aware applications can be developed. The success of this research will motivate computer architects and compiler writers to provide energy-accuracy trade-off features to software developers with the aim of realizing an energy-efficient computing platform running energy-aware applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate control knobs and optimal parameters to achieve desired bit-error-rate (BER) with minimum energy per bit.

This project will also investigate energy-scalable universal transmitter architectures, with the ability to support different pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) formats (PAM-4/8/16/32), different pulse width modulation (PWM) formats (PWM-4/8/16), and equalization methods on these modulations will be investigated. Furthermore, time-domain processing circuits at the receivers will be investigated, which can effectively trade-off energy consumption with accuracy. The approach of this project is unique because it focuses on improving energy efficiency through accuracy-energy trade-off, while other existing approaches focus on improving the efficiency of individual wireline circuits for a fixed accuracy. Energy-scalable techniques and architectures invented as part of this research can also be used to achieve approximate optical communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The US electricity infrastructure is increasingly prone to climatic risks that cause wide-spread and sustained outages, costing billions of dollars annually. While natural hazard-induced failures in the transmission grid lead to large-scale and costly impacts, the existing transmission expansion planning models largely neglect resilience consideration of the network facing natural hazards. The purely data-driven approaches prevalent in resilience analytics of power distribution systems, however, are not applicable to transmission systems due to relative scarcity of data. A unilateral reliance on physics-based models is not feasible either due to their extreme computational costs, limiting their ability to scale up to the network level. This NSF grant seeks to address this fundamental gap via deep integration of physics-based and data driven methods. The outcome of this research is expected to help key decision-makers for the transmission infrastructure to characterize resilience under various uncertain future scenarios and identify optimal adaptation or mitigation strategies. The research program is complemented with educating the next generation of scholars in modeling hazards and infrastructure resilience through an interdisciplinary, research-integrated educational program, a strong commitment to increased diversity in student training and broad dissemination of the results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research approach is grounded in the latest developments in big data analytics as well as physics-based analysis of structural failures.

Novel limit state functions for failure quantification of transmission networks will be established and a scalable approach to uncertainty quantification of structural systems will be developed. The multiscale approach to modeling uncertain processes will effectively fuse data on transmission systems with computational models of the infrastructure. The developed methodologies and data will shed new lights on the vulnerability of the transmission system under future hazard scenarios, and enable assessing the impact of investment decisions on transmission system resilience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The solutions of many problems in the applied sciences could ultimately depend on improvements in these complex analytic tools and in a deeper understanding of their basic properties. This project provides research training for graduate students, and the principal investigator will continue mentoring postdocs and organizing conferences on several complex variables and complex geometry, bringing together mathematicians to discuss their research and teaching.<br/><br/>The principal investigator will work on several fundamental problems in complex analysis of several variables that are closely related to research in differential geometry, subelliptic analysis and classical dynamics. More specifically, he plans to continue his research on the equivalence problem and the rigidity problem in several complex variables, to carry further his work on the complex structure of the holomorphic hull of a real submanifold in a complex space, and to investigate various boundary CR invariants, including the famous Bloom conjecture in any dimension.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigators seek demonstrate nanometer-scale and molecular-level tuning of material properties to create nano-engineered surfaces, or so-called “super-surfaces”.  The project will also train diverse scientists and engineers through interdisciplinary science, technology, engineering, and math education. A pilot undergraduate nanoscience program will be created for undergraduates, including rural, first-generation, non-traditional, and Hispanic students. This will provide students, including underrepresented groups, an opportunity to research and network with faculty and students at a major research university.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to demonstrate a novel technique for molecular-level tuning of interfacial thermal conductance, surface charge, capillary properties, and biological interaction of solid-liquid interfaces using a model gold-alkanethiol-water system. By employing a highly synergistic, integrated experimental and theoretical approach (to design, synthesize, and then re-design microscale surfaces), the study will advance the fundamental understanding of mixed monolayer structure, dynamics, and interfacial interactions. These studies will extend to a systematic investigation of cooling rate and substrate curvature on functionalized thiol domain formation on both flat substrates and nanoparticles. By demonstrating a commercially scalable technique for tuning solid-liquid interfacial transport properties and biomolecular sensitivity of surfaces with nanometer precision, the project addresses significant applied research needs in the field. This work is anticipated to lead to the development of a new nanoscale manufacturing paradigm for the rational engineering of solid-fluid interfaces that can be applied to a broad range of functional molecules and substrates. Additionally, it will explore possible means to control interfacial transport and biological interactions with functionalized and nanostructured materials.  Thus, these studies will provide considerable cross-cutting scientific and technological benefits, which will improve the overall quality of human life and health. Because the project will also establish a pilot collaborative nanoscience program including students from two primarily undergraduate institutions (Colorado Mesa University and Central Washington University), which serve large Hispanic, rural, first generation, and non-traditional student populations, with students and researchers at University of Notre Dame, this project will contribute to the diversity of the scientific workforce. Specifically, the integrated research and education design of the studies will aid in student engagement, retention, and success. Because of the COVID pandemic, the PIs at all three institutions are actively engaged in developing a plan for inter- and intra- institutional collaborative research during the pandemic, planning for increased laboratory safety and utilizing information technology solutions for communications to mitigate the disruptive effects of the pandemic on the project activities while assuring researcher safety.

There is great interest, both scientifically and technologically, in semiconductors that can emit light with wavelengths somewhat longer than visible light, i.e. in the mid-infrared part of the spectrum. Such light sources, when fabricated on silicon chips, could become key components in future ubiquitous chemical sensor networks, in speeding up data transfer between and on silicon chips, and in motion sensors required by autonomous vehicles. This research project focuses on a semiconductor material system, germanium-tin, that holds great promise for mid-infrared light emission on silicon chips. The efficiency of light emission by germanium-tin is limited by the presence of atomic scale defects that grow into the material when it is synthesized. This project characterizes the nature and number of such defects, and investigates methods for annihilating or altering them to minimize their effects on germanium-tin. Undergraduates are involved in these research activities, with special efforts made to recruit highly competitive undergraduate researchers from groups that are under-represented in the US science and engineering workforce. The project includes a partnership with Stanford’s RISE outreach program, to inspire high school students to consider further education and careers in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;Exhibiting a direct bandgap at sufficiently large (x ~ 10 atomic %) tin composition, Ge(1-x)Sn(x) alloys hold great promise for mid-infrared (IR) light emitters and absorbers, while also being monolithically compatible with silicon electronic and photonic technologies. Previous research on germanium-tin epitaxial films grown on silicon has demonstrated mid-IR optically-pumped lasing, and there has been a gradual trend of increasing Sn content to access longer wavelength operation. The light emission characteristics of Ge(1-x)Sn(x) are still far from optimal. Low growth temperatures (&lt; 300°C) used to promote high Sn content alloys cause large concentrations of acceptor-type vacancy defects to form.  Strong pairing of Sn atoms with these vacancies is predicted theoretically and will result in enhanced non-radiative carrier recombination, reducing the efficiency of light emission and absorption. This project uses strain-engineered core-shell nanowire structures as a platform to study post-growth annealing to dissociate Sn-vacancy pairs and to annihilate vacancies incorporated in the Ge(1-x)Sn(x) shells during their growth. Shells of thickness up to 500 nm are of particular interest, to achieve wire structures capable of efficiently guiding mid-IR light. Synchrotron diffuse x-ray scattering is used to characterize trends in the relative concentration of vacancies bound to Sn atoms, divacancies, clusters and monovacancies in the alloys versus annealing time and temperature. A key goal is to understand the rates and mechanisms governing the approach to vacancy equilibrium in these alloys. Extended x-ray absorption fine structure analysis provides an additional probe of local bonding around Sn atoms and the stability of Sn-vacancy pairs. The project also examines atomic fluorine as a chemical vacancy passivant, building on prior experience with F passivation of Si surface states and vacancies in Ge. Coupling between x-ray and optoelectronic characterization of the core-shell wires can reveal fundamental insights into the connection between point defects and device-relevant properties. Temperature-dependent photoluminescence, photoconductivity and ultra-fast pump-probe measurements are used to probe Ge(1-x)Sn(x) band structure and the effects of different vacancy defect populations on carrier recombination dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Developing this novel technology would also help maintain the nation's continued leadership in wireless technologies and its pipeline of highly qualified engineers. <br/><br/>The project pursues synergistic activities for the successful design and implementation of Dino-RL, followed by a comprehensive, real-world data driven evaluation. Episodic RL is first studied with the objective to incorporate domain knowledge into building an efficient episodic memory. In addition, a hierarchical hidden variable model is built to enable meta-reinforcement learning for knowledge transfer and efficient exploration. Lastly, the conflict between enhancing the physical-law based modeling and reinforcement learning is balanced via novel sample-efficient model selection algorithms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The team studies what happens to additives in plastics as the plastics slowly decay in the environment.  Complex chemical compounds are added the during manufacturing of plastics to improve their properties, such as durability, color and texture. The chemical composition of these additives is very varied and can include small organic molecules as well as metal-containing organic compounds. The accumulation of plastic waste in aquatic environments is a highly visible problem of increasing global concern.  When plastics are in contact with water or exposed to sunlight, the chemical additives are slowly released into the water. There they can undergo chemical transformation to form new compounds. Unfortunately, a number of additives and their transformation products have been found to pose a risk to the environment and to human health. Information from this study can help improve our understanding of the science to guide the design of new additives with reduced environmental impacts. The students involved in this research acquire skills in materials chemistry and environmental science. Students at the K-12 and university level participate in educational activities, such as hands-on experiences with end-of-life issues with plastics. <br/><br/>The project aims to develop a molecular level understanding of how the chemical composition and physical characteristics of additives in polymers influence the release and subsequent photochemical transformations of additives in aqueous environments. These goals are accomplished by measuring additive release kinetics and sorption properties from a selected set of well characterized additive/polymer composites. This is complemented by measurements of phototransformation kinetics and transformation products using a suite of highly sensitive mass spectrometry techniques.  Model organic and organometallic compounds are used to test hypotheses and develop structure activity relationships related to additive release and photochemical transformations. These models address the role of molecular level properties of additives, polymer-additive interactions, and changes in polymer surface properties in determining the behavior of additives in aqueous environments. The results can be extrapolated to a wide range of additive/polymer combinations relevant to plastic pollution in the aquatic environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To prepare agricultural technicians for work in precision technologies, the project will develop two agriculture technology programs that are aligned to local agricultural industry needs.  These programs will be designed so that students can develop both technical and higher order competencies and industry-supported credentials.  With these skills and credentials, the students will be able to enter the agricultural technician workforce at middle-skilled levels. This project aims to increase the skilled technical workforce in Northeast Georgia, thus increasing the ability of employers to recruit skilled agricultural technicians locally. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project plans to develop two new academic programs that can prepare students for technical work in modern agricultural industries: Agribusiness; and Modern Diversified Agriculture. Two complementary goals will be pursued. The first is to develop experiential, diversified curricula specific to the needs of the local agriculture industry. The second is to recruit and retain Appalachian students in these agricultural technician programs. The curricula will be designed through a partnership with the agriculture industry and local agriculture advisory committee members.  The curricula will focus on providing students with hands-on opportunities in the context of learning laboratories. The project will engage a pool of student who are largely untapped due to a lack of awareness of the available positions and a lack of access to the technical education needed to fill the positions. Information in the project annual evaluation reports will be used to measure project success, to adjust strategies, and to inform stakeholders about project progress.

Global, continuous observations from 1 Jan 2010 provided a wealth of science products for over 85 papers covering a wide range of magnetosphere-ionosphere science. Following the success of these previous projects, this award is to support the collection of data from the Iridium NEXT satellites and the development of data products as community resources. In eight launches from Jan 2017 through Jan 2019 the new generation of 75 Iridium NEXT satellites were launched by Iridium Communications Inc. and all NEXT Space Vehicles (SVs) were successfully commissioned and are operating nominally. <br/><br/>The data collected from the NEXT Space Vehicles that are designed to support data collection for AMPERE, will be used to monitor the near-Earth space environment for space weather events, with specific focus on the electric currents at the poles. It will be applied to a variety of phenomena including examination of geomagnetic storms and geomagnetically induced currents. Data is downlinked and transferred to The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) as each NEXT SV was commissioned and has continued with >99% continuous acquisition and higher sampling rate than previous data sets.

The discovery and design of such alloys demand a detailed knowledge of the thermodynamic factors governing stability in a very high dimensional composition space with potentially many competing crystal structures. This complexity tests the limits of current thermodynamic modeling capabilities due to the sheer number of input data needed and of parameters entering the model. The project addresses this by combining (i) large-scale meta-databases of experimentally-derived thermodynamic models with (ii) thermodynamic data from high-throughput quantum-mechanical calculations, using formal statistical and active machine learning techniques. The end product of this effort is an openly distributed large-scale encompassing thermodynamic model that can be queried in a high-dimensional compositional space and that returns structural stability information as interactive tridimensional cross-sections, or as composition- and temperature-dependent thermodynamic properties. As this space of possible alloys is so vast compared to the number of known high-entropy alloys, the potential for discoveries of novel alloys through this tool is significant and this could broadly impact numerous engineering applications where capabilities are limited by materials properties.<br/><br/>Technical summary<br/><br/>The project leverages and integrates two recent developments from the PI's group: (i) a search engine (the Thermodynamic DataBase DataBase or TDBDB), that indexes all available experimentally-derived thermodynamic data electronically available in standardized format in the scientific literature; (ii) a suite of software tools (the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit or ATAT) that streamlines the generation of thermodynamic databases from ab initio data. This hybrid approach aims to combine the distinct advantage of state-of-the-art experimental and computational methods, namely, the higher accuracy of the former and the high-throughput nature of the latter.<br/><br/>Active machine learning and statistical techniques are used to (i) target the exploration of promising composition regions likely to form solid solutions with simple crystal structures and (ii) develop efficient statistical mechanics models of non-stoichiometric solids that require few ab initio inputs, thus enabling ""high-throughput"" operation. Whereas existing computational high-throughput efforts primarily focus on the properties of defect-free stoichiometric compounds at absolute zero, this project targets, at all temperatures, the broader range of materials including disordered alloys with possible short-range order and ordered alloys with possible point defects. This demands efficient statistical mechanical models of (i) short-range order, (ii) strongly anharmonic phases and (iii) magnetic ordering, each of which requiring fewer ab initio input than existing brute force methods, by exploiting both known and data-mined trends.<br/><br/>The data and tools devised during this project are expected to have broader impacts: virtually all engineering materials are nonstoichiometric alloys whose properties are tuned by controlled additions of numerous components (with high entropy alloys only representing an extreme example). Hence, this resource could greatly facilitate materials discovery and optimization by augmenting existing computational high-throughput efforts that currently only target ordered compounds at absolute zero. The broad compositional gamut covered also enables applications that could range from identifying glass-forming metallic alloys to determining possible exoplanet core compositions and structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This challenge, also known as Straggler bottleneck, incurs large delays and failures due to computing nodes that are significantly slower than the rest; and (2) Communication Bottleneck, which is due to the massive amounts of raw or processed data that must be moved around the network. To tackle these bottlenecks, this project proposes techniques from coding theory and optimization theory to develop distributed learning algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees and empirical performance. <br/><br/>Wireless distributed learning systems are driven by scaling out computations across many wireless edge nodes. There are, however, two major systems bottlenecks that arise: (1) Straggler Delay Bottleneck, which is due to the latency in waiting for slowest nodes to finish their tasks; (2) Data Shuffling Bottleneck, which is due to the massive amounts of data that must be moved among nodes. Moreover, there are privacy concerns about sharing sensitive local data, as well as vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. This proposal aims to develop novel techniques from coding theory and optimization theory to tackle the mentioned bottlenecks and concerns. The project develops new ""coded computing"" algorithms for robust gradient aggregation, as well as new optimization algorithms for distributed learning. These algorithms are then used in two network settings to develop communication-efficient, straggler-resilient, and robust distributed learning frameworks: (i) a collaborative setting where a learning task is allocated to multiple edge nodes of the network. In this setting, data points can be encoded and offloaded to the edge nodes to provide resiliency against system bottlenecks; (ii) a federated setting where data points are gathered locally at edge devices and have to remain local due to privacy concerns.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Not only on the surface, water (hydrogen) is present inside of Earth and slowly circulates. This global water circulation creates and maintains oceans on Earth. Based on a number of studies during the last a few decades, there is a clear idea about the water circulation in the shallow part of Earth’s interior. However, the nature of water circulation in the largest part of the mantle, the lower mantle, remains poorly constrained. A key in the global water circulation is the role of melting. Melting removes water from minerals to melt, and melt migrates a long distance to cause large-scale water transport. However, the nature of global water circulation in the deep mantle is very poorly understood mainly because our understanding of water in the minerals in the deep mantle is limited.  The PI team will bring together a suite of theoretical and experimental methods to address these questions, and will train both graduate and undergraduate students at three institutions on a cross-cutting research project.  The PIs will also engage in public outreach events.<br/><br/>In this new project, the water solubility in bridgmanite (dominant lower mantle mineral) will be determined under the shallow lower mantle conditions from ~660 km to ~1000 km depth, and also the role of water (hydrogen) on electrical conductivity in bridgmanite will be investigated. Experimental studies will be made on clean single crystals of bridgmanite and the hydrogen content and solubility mechanisms will be studied using FTIR and SIMS. Electrical conductivity will be measured on these samples for different orientations using the AC impedance spectroscopy. First-principle computational studies will also be made on hydrogen solubility and mobility in bridgmanite to help interpreting the experimental results.

2003325.xml,Elucidating Structural Transformations in MoTe2 for Efficient Optoelectronic Memory,NSF,2020-07-01,2024-06-30,501953,"Non-technical abstract:<br/>In the information age, affordable and efficient optical and electrical memory is foundational to the preservation and dissemination of knowledge and ideas. Materials which undergo a phase transition, such as chalcogenides that are commonly used in DVDs, are especially promising for emerging applications which combine memory with high-speed computing but require relatively large programming energies which is proportional to the volume of material switched. Encoding data in two-dimensional (2D) materials such as molybdenum tellurides (MoTe2) provides a direct route to overcome this fundamental limitation. Among available 2D materials which can undergo a phase transition, MoTe2 is predicted to be the most energy efficient, but there is a distinct lack of experimental evidence to support conflicting theoretical models governing the mechanisms, dynamics, and limitations of optically-induced phase transformations in MoTe2. The team proposes to address this knowledge gap using dynamic optical measurement techniques in combination with ultrahigh-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The project overcomes the experimental limitations of prior works to shed new light on related 2D materials for applications requiring high-speed, reliable, and efficient optoelectronic memory. The team seeks to educate middle- and high-school students on topics related to nanomaterials in daily life from districts with historically under-represented minorities in STEM fields using a combination of interactive workshops and virtual reality tools. This project also provides training for two graduate students in nanofabrication and characterization techniques and hosts undergraduates from underrepresented groups during the summer months to broaden participation in STEM-related fields.<br/><br/>Technical abstract:<br/>Phase-change materials that enable optoelectronic memory have the potential to transform low-energy, non-von Neumann computing architectures by processing information in memory at the speed of light. A phase-change material that is atomically flat (e.g. MoTe2 and its alloy Mo1-xWxTe2) would further reduce the energy required to configure its state by drastically reducing the active volume undergoing a phase transition. While optically induced phase transformations have been observed in MoTe¬2 and related materials, these transformations have been irreversible unlike similar observations employing electrochemical doping and mechanical strain. Limited empirical evidence and theoretical modeling indicates Te vacancies play a central role in the phase transition process, but a clear understanding of the dynamics and physical mechanism of optical switching between the 2H and 1T’ phases in MoTe2 remains elusive to date. The team proposes that optically induced structural transformations can be controlled in MoTe2 through material synthesis, encapsulation, and W-alloying, resulting in higher operating speeds, improved reliability, and lower switching energies. To test this hypothesis, the project contains the following three aims: (1) determine the influence of Te vacancies on the optical switching power by engineering the concentration of Te vacancies during the MoTe2 growth process; (2) encapsulate MoTe2 to reduce Te loss during optical excitation—the expected mechanism preventing reversible optical switching; and (3) alloy MoTe2 with W to engineer an optimal 2D material for efficient and rewriteable optoelectronic phase-change memory. The proposed approach overcomes the temporal limitations of prior experimental techniques by probing the phase-transition process in the optical domain. The proposed research is expected to enable the development of high-speed, non-volatile, and efficient data storage by exploiting structural transformations in MoTe2 to encode information. This study is the first to use a combination of optical and electro-optical techniques to resolve conflicting theoretical models regarding the phase transformation mechanisms, dynamics, and optimal stoichiometry of MoTe2 and its alloy Mo1-xWxTe2. New insights into phase-transformation process of MoTe2 are expected to have broad application to fields beyond data storage, such as neuromorphic computing, electro-optic conversion, flexible electronics, and reconfigurable topological and quantum devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Compared to their White male counterparts, African American males are commonly underrepresented in STEM. With increasing American workforce needs in STEM, more research is needed that focuses on broadening participation in STEM among historically underrepresented populations, including African American males. Much of the current research on African American male students' STEM experiences tends to focus on college students and those who are low achieving or underachieving in STEM. This research project is both timely and significant. The investigators at The Ohio State University and University of South Florida outline a comprehensive research project that examines how participation in high school career academies may help to promote viable STEM pathways for high-achieving (students with a 3.5 GPA or higher), low-income African American male students. The investigators seek to document the experiences of low-income, high-achieving African American male high school students focusing on: (a) their experiences in high school STEM academies; (b) factors (e.g., school supports) that influenced their motivation to participate and persist in STEM academies; and (c) their family support systems contributing to their success. Potential research findings are likely to help the STEM community pinpoint the different positive and negative challenges that low-income, African American males experience in high school, especially those who are high achieving.

Findings from this research will be shared through academic publications as well as through podcasts, webcasts and research briefs. These findings can inform the development innovative high school strategies and programs that encourage and promote the academic and career success of high-achieving, African American males, who are interested in STEM.

By optimizing the MR pulse sequence to be sensitive to variations between tissue compartments, it will be possible to collect information about microstructure which cannot currently be measured directly in vivo, including water exchange rates between tissue compartments and intracellular/extracellular volume fractions.  The specific objectives of the proposal are to: 1) Develop a technique (MRF-X) for rapid and robust in vivo quantification of volume fractions and exchange properties, 2) Characterize and validate water exchange rates and volume fraction in healthy skeletal muscle and brain tissue, 3) Explore the use of water exchange as a biomarker for disease in the brain by comparing properties of normal brain tissue and multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions, and 4) Develop formal course work and laboratory experiences linking signal processing and medical imaging for undergraduate and graduate students, introduce K-12 students to biomedical imaging and engineering, and encourage women and underrepresented minorities to pursue science and engineering. The proposed research plan involves the development of new imaging techniques with the goal of addressing fundamental questions about the nature of interactions between tissue compartments and how they are modified under pathological conditions. Using MRF-X, it will be possible to explore tissue structure and function in healthy living tissue, and also to use these new biomarkers to aid in the understanding and diagnosis of disease. The development of a robust and rapid technique for in vivo tissue microstructure characterization will ensure that the technique is immediately translatable for clinical use, potentially leading to earlier and more accurate diagnosis of disease. Moreover, it will be possible to probe the underlying mechanisms of various diseases, including but not limited to Alzheimer?s disease and MS, using MRF-X. The education and mentorship of K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students will be integrated into the research to engage students, especially women and underrepresented minorities, in biomedical imaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award was made by the Biomedical Engineering program of CBET was co-funded by the Mathematical Biology program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences."

It also will examine if and how employer characteristics are related to the potentially stigmatizing effects of such awards. In recent decades, many universities and companies have used scholarships, fellowships, and pipeline programs to achieve organizational goals. These programs offer members of some groups additional opportunities and resources but in doing so may label the recipients.  Prior research has found that beneficiaries may be seen as less warm and less competent.  The findings from this project will provide greater understanding of how opportunity-enhancing programs and awards may have unintended negative effects on their beneficiaries’ outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses a survey experiment to measure employer perceptions of scholarship winners. The sample consists of hiring managers and other professionals with recruiting and hiring experience. Respondents are randomly assigned resumés to review and are asked to answer questions about their perceptions of the job applicants represented by the resumés. The resumés experimentally manipulate the demographic group of the applicant and kind of scholarship received. The survey experiment will be complemented by a field experiment with similar experimental manipulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002506.xml,P2C2: Collaborative Research: Transient forcing of the Local Last Glacial Maximum in the tropical Peruvian Andes,NSF,2020-06-15,2025-05-31,305859,"The geological history of tropical glaciers can provide scientists an important perspective from the past on how Earth’s climate system responds to human activity. This project will look to the geological record of tropical glaciers in the Andes Mountains for a perspective on past changes in the glacial ice extent and how these changes may relate to records of changes in the atmospheric conditions during periods of abrupt climate change. These records of glacial activity will help place the current state of rapidly retreating ice margins in the tropics in a longer-term context that extends well beyond the instrumental record. Finally, by integrating multiple archives of past climates and modeling the causes of tropical high elevation climate changes, this work will improve our understanding of abrupt global climate changes because these regions had much larger glaciers in the past. By determining ages on the rocks that were transported by the ancient glaciers and combining analyses of lake sediments deposited continuously below the glaciers, this research will provide a detailed record of how much the glaciers changed and when. The research team will incorporate climate model simulations to test the causes of tropical climate changes and how they relate to high latitude warming and cooling events. This project will train 3 graduate students, and at least 4 undergraduate students. The project team will improve K-12 science education and engagement by exposing teachers and students (both local and abroad) to research through the GLOBE program (Global Learning and Observation to Benefit the Environment). The team also will partner with INAIGEM in Peru to broaden project impact, and help with the mission of educational capacity building.<br/> <br/>This project will evaluate tropical glacial variability during the local Last Glacial Maximum (LLGM) to better understand how low latitude temperature variability and the hydrologic cycle were modulated by ocean and atmospheric processes. This research has the following objectives: 1) determine robust ages of moraines using terrestrial cosmogenic radionuclide (TCN) dating methods to provide information about both the timing and extent of multiple LLGM ice limits; 2) rigorously evaluate centennial-scale records of glacial flour flux using high-resolution geochemical archives from the recently acquired Lake Junín drill-core record; 3) test the scale and climatic forcing of LLGM climate variability using climate model simulations; 4) test the scale of LLGM glacier variability responses to climatic forcing using energy and mass-balance models. This research will produce multi-proxy, centennial-scale records of mountain glaciation in Peru spanning the LLGM, at a scale and resolution that has not yet been achieved. This resolution will be sufficient to make comparisons with ice cores from Greenland, Antarctica, and the tropical Andes, as well as decadal-scale speleothem-based stable isotope records of hydroclimate changes from the same (Lake Junín) catchment. This will allow for a collective evaluation of mountain glacier archives and other regional records of past atmospheric variability that will improve our understanding of the role of the tropics in abrupt global change events on millennial timescales. These records will provide insight on the sensitivity of tropical glaciers to a range of climate conditions, both atmospheric and oceanic, and particularly how the tropical climate system responds to meltwater forcing. Ultimately, these records will inform how the tropical hydrologic cycle drives glacial-interglacial cycles in both the low and high latitudes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Level 1 STEM learning and learning environments project aims to broaden understanding of who is affected by modeling-based instruction in undergraduate life sciences, and how they are affected. Modeling is vital to STEM professions and national standards call for modeling instruction at all levels of STEM education. Despite behavioral work indicating that modeling-based instruction enhances STEM learning, there is a critical gap in understanding what mechanisms make it effective and which students benefit most from this instructional approach. The proposed project draws on the body of knowledge about STEM expertise from cognitive science. Specifically, as disciplinary experts interact with or create models of biological systems, they continuously engage in error checking to evaluate a model’s credibility and simultaneously inhibit information that is irrelevant to the task.  Specific regions of the experts' brains become activated as they evaluate models.  These regions include the lateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate regions, which are linked to error detection and inhibition. These observations suggest that error checking and inhibition are integral brain functions for development of STEM expertise.  However, it is not known whether undergraduate STEM students, who are not yet disciplinary experts, use similar processes and associated neural systems during modeling-based instruction. It is also not yet known whether error checking and inhibition influence students’ long-term retention of disciplinary and modeling knowledge. A deeper understanding about how modeling-based instruction benefits students and for whom it is most effective may be used to develop more effective STEM instruction to meet the needs of all students. <br/><br/>The goals of this project are to (a) describe the nature and extent to which undergraduate life sciences students engage in error detection and inhibition during model evaluation, and (b) determine how these processes are associated with long-term knowledge retention. Interviews with students will enable characterization of the types and extent of error detection.  Brain scans using fMRI will determine the functional neural responses. Comparative interviews and neurological scans after one year of instruction will determine how variation in ability to detect errors predicts long-term retention of conceptual and model-based knowledge. Results from this research will be disseminated at research conferences and through peer-reviewed literature. The research will inform development of a modeling-based instruction case study on learning for undergraduate life science students. The proposed project is a joint effort between the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Michigan State University and is supported by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Federated learning (also known as, collaborative learning) techniques work across multiple decentralized edge devices and/or servers holding local data samples and facilitate training of the algorithms by exchanging parameters (i.e., weights associated with deep networks) instead of the actual data samples. Federated learning over wireless networks is challenging because of data loss associated with the communication characteristics. The goal of this project is to provide their critically needed augmented intelligence by enabling federated learning at the wireless edge, via an innovative framework, named coded computing. The societal impact of democratizing machine learning on low cost edge devices is also expected to be vast. For instance, smart edge networks that track safety automatically and continuously in workplaces can have a significant societal and economic impact. This project paves the path towards scalable realization of such applications. <br/><br/>Coded computing has been hugely successful for large-scale distributed machine learning, where one can judiciously create computational redundancy in a coded manner to efficiently deal with communication bottleneck and system disturbances such as stragglers, outages, node failures, and adversarial computations -- precisely the set of challenges that hobble distributed wireless edge computations for machine learning. This project leads to the development of theory and algorithms for federated machine learning over wireless that are driven by fundamental principles informed by coding and information theory. In particular, this project holistically addresses the challenges of (i) wireless bandwidth costs, (ii) resiliency to wireless outages, (iii) security, and (iv) prioritizing user data privacy that is critical for large-scale user participation in wireless edge computing. Another key aspect of wireless networks is that mobile users join and leave the network arbitrarily, and user locations can change frequently. The research team will develop a federated learning framework that can adapt to such dynamic network topologies by designing a self-configurable protocol that can accommodate new users on-the-go, thereby adapting to the changes in the network topology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Accomplishing these multitude of functions requires the bats to control, adapt, and coordinate their wing motions, body posture, and internal actions that they engage in while airborne. This project seeks to understand how bats master the integration of kinematics, aerodynamics, and control in such complex aerial behaviors.  This would shed light on underlying fluid dynamics and kinematic controls in biology, and also impact  the ability for engineers to replicate such abilities in technical systems in the next-generation multiple-functioning drones with flapping flight. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to understand aerial multi-tasking by bats based on comprehensive experiments and mathematical models. The project will obtain experimental data from two different approaches: The morphing wing kinematics of the bats during demanding flight maneuvers and behavioral multi-tasking situations will be recorded with an array of synchronized high-speed cameras and processed with deep learning methods. These biological data will be complemented by experiments with a biomimetic robotic system that will be implemented to mimic the bats' morphing wings and will be used to explore a larger parameter spaces than would be possible with observations of the animals. This will provide insights into the effects of different kinematic patterns. In parallel, mathematical models of flapping flight will be developed to extract the key physics in the sophisticated maneuvers seen the in the experiments. The simulation of flapping flight will further elucidate the trade-off between the energetics and stability of flight.

Peptoids are peptide-mimics but with the side chain connected to the nitrogen of the peptide backbone. Because this unique backbone structure, they often are more stable in biological systems and can be used for therapeutic applications. Professor Kirshenbaum's project explores how organizing the peptoids into cyclic structures may enable the design of new molecules with elaborate structures and valuable functions. The broader impacts of the project include collaborations with researchers on the chemical biology of cancer and creation of intellectual property for commercial development of bioactive peptidomimetics.

2001022.xml,"A fully calibrated astronomical time scale for the Cenozoic: Dating, climate forcing, and solar system chaos",NSF,2020-06-01,2024-05-31,259841,"To determine the ages of seafloor sediments and sedimentary rocks geologists need a “calendar” of the past. One such calendar, called the astronomical time scale, makes use of the fact that predictable changes in the orbits of the planets drive cyclic changes in Earth’s climate. In this approach observed cycles in sediment composition are matched to climate cycles. The timing of those cycles is then calculated by computing planetary orbits backward in time. The astronomical time scale is a valuable tool because the orbital calculations provide accurate ages for the geologic record. Recent work by the PI provided new astronomical calculations that stretch back to 58 million years before the present (Myr BP). Those calculations were then compared with deep sea sediment records. The comparisons yielded a new history of climate events during the early Eocene (56 to 53 Myr BP). They also yielded new information about the chaotic motions of the solar system. The proposed study will provide a fully tested astronomical time scale and new astronomical calculations extending back through the Paleocene (66 to 56 Myr BP). The astronomical calculations will provide a time scale for the sediment records. At the same time the cyclic patterns observed in the sediments will constrain calculations of the planets’ orbital variations. That new time scale will pave the way to an accurate time scale extending back through the Cretaceous period (145 to 66 Myr BP). It will also help improve dating methods that use radioactive elements. Finally, it will improve our knowledge of the chaotic evolution of our solar system. The project will also support a graduate student.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of an astronomical time scale (ATS) based on astronomical solutions has transformed the dating of geologic archives and represents the backbone of marine cyclostratigraphy and astrochronology to reconstruct Earth’s history. While the stable 405-kyr cycle of Earth’s orbital eccentricity has been used to provide floating (relative) chronologies across various time scales, one major challenge remains: Development of an absolute, fully calibrated astronomical time scale beyond ~50 Ma, which has hitherto been hampered by the fact that orbital solutions disagree before that age due to solar system chaos. We have recently made progress in providing a new astronomical solution to ~58 Ma by testing against deep-sea sediment archives (~58-53 Ma), which also yielded critical insight into the chronology of early Eocene hyperthermals and solar system chaos. This project will develop and provide a fully calibrated ATS and a new astronomical solution including the Paleocene (~66-56 Ma), which, combined with our recent work, will then span the entire Cenozoic. The key idea of our study is to use marine geology to constrain astronomy, and, conversely, use astronomy to provide key applications widely used in marine geology. Reaching beyond 58 Ma presents new challenges, which will require analyses of multiple geologic records and significant computational resources. Cyclostratigraphic signals are challenging to interpret in deep-sea records across the interval ~66-63 Ma, for which we will integrate land-based marine sections in our analysis (e.g., Zumaia, Spain). The expression of Earth’s orbital eccentricity in the geologic archives will then guide our search for an astronomical solution, using numerical (ensemble) integrations of the orbital motion of the solar system. Specifically, we will use marine deep-sea records of color reflectance and iron intensities from ODP Sites 1262 and 1209 and cyclostratigraphy from land-based marine sections (Zumaia) to reconstruct Earth’s orbital eccentricity across the critical interval ~66-56 Ma. Based on the eccentricity expression observed in the records, we will search for a new astronomical solution that will allow us to extend the fully calibrated astronomically time scale to ~66 Ma. In summary, our study will (1) provide a fully calibrated ATS across the Cenozoic, (2) help gauge radiometric dating calibrations, (3) test correlations between eccentricity amplitude modulation and Paleocene climate events, (4) model forcing of Paleocene climate-carbon cycle feedbacks, and (5) transform our knowledge of the chaotic evolution of our solar system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to cool this melt, seawater penetrates the ocean crust, resulting in many chemical changes of both the rocks of the crust as well as the oceans. Thus, “hydrothermal” fluid flow is a primary mechanism for mass and heat transfer between the deep Earth and the oceans, accounting for approximately one third of the global yearly heat loss. Of particular interest are hydrothermal systems hosted in rocks that were brought up from the deeper mantle, so-called “ultramafic” rocks due to their composition. This is because: (1) the mechanisms that produce such mantle exposures are not fully understood; (2) there is potential for these ultramafic rocks to sequester CO2 sequestration; and (3) the fluids resulting from hydration of ultramafic rocks can create unique chemical environments that are important for biology on earth. This project will use an existing dataset acquired in 2013 that probes the subsurface of such an ultramafic exposure beneath an active hydrothermal system along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This project will serve the national interest by promoting the progress of science, in particular by investigating the linkages and interactions between mantle rocks, fluids, and (sub)surface ecosystems. This is a major scientific goal of the geoscience community and its importance has been highlighted in science plans providing guidance to scientists, funding agencies and policy makers, such as the IODP Science Plan for 2013-2023 or The National Academy of Sciences Sea Change 2015-2025 Decadal Survey of Ocean Sciences Report. This project will support a postdoctoral investigator, providing an opportunity for developing the early career of an independent scientist, and contributing to the new generation of geoscientists with expertise in advanced seismic imaging techniques. Such expertise is of great importance for the US industries in the field of exploration and production of natural resources. By making use of existing seismic datasets, this project will also leverage previous NSF investments in marine seismic acquisition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will conduct a multi-scale advanced seismic modeling and imaging study of a subset of a seismic data collected in 2013. These data were collected as part of the NSF-funded MARINER experiment in the Rainbow massif of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The dataset includes active-source long-streamer seismic reflection data, ocean bottom seismometer wide-angle data, and a microseismicity catalog. The approach will consist of (1) downward continuation and travel-time tomography, yielding intermediate resolution models of the P-wave velocity structure; (2) elastic full waveform inversion, yielding high-resolution models of the P-wave velocity structure; (3) reverse time migration, yielding geometrically accurate, high fidelity seismic reflection images; and (4) micro-earthquake tomography, yielding a km-scale regional 3-D model of the S-wave velocity structure. These models and images will be used to investigate the physical properties of magmatic rocks within the oceanic crust. They will help to quantify their partially molten or solidified state, and how they are linked to active and inactive hydrothermal fields. Furthermore, the models and images will illuminate fluid pathways and small-scale faulting, potential connecting the seafloor hydrothermal fields to the magmatic system at depth. The results, when jointly interpreted with existing seafloor geology observations, seafloor sampling and near-bottom imagery from previous studies will provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of magmatism and other geological controls on hydrothermal activity in regions of mantle exposures along mid-ocean ridges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will generate new information for K-12 level to promote STEM education and create public awareness about environment and sustainable systems. <br/><br/>The overall objective of this research is to develop an economic, sustainable and environment-friendly bio-binder from algae through a thermochemical liquefaction process, then directly mix bio-binder with epoxy to completely replace conventional epoxy hardener and partially replace the epoxy resin. The collaborative research team will identify culture conditions of algae, reveal processing parameters of algae thermochemical liquefaction, and optimize manufacturing/curing conditions of the epoxy resin/bio-binder system. Particularly, the research will uncover the relationships among hydrothermal liquefaction parameters, contents of reactive functional groups in bio-binder, degree of cross-linking reaction in the curing process, and final mechanical properties of the cured products. The research will eventually generate a novel epoxy resin system for high-performance, sustainable, and economic epoxy-based nanocomposite materials. The research team will also perform molecular dynamic simulation to understand and predict mechanical properties of the epoxy resin/bio-binder system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000193.xml,Expanding Pathways from High School into the Biotechnology Workforce,NSF,2020-09-01,2025-08-31,493912,"The nation’s capital region, including Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, D.C., is an expanding hub of biotechnology innovation and industry. Consequently, the number of biotechnology jobs is projected to increase in the region, as well as nationally. Despite the growing workforce demand, the public has a limited understanding of the biotechnology field or its promising career options. In addition, high school students, including students from economically challenged, underrepresented, and/or rural backgrounds, have limited exposure to the range of possible college and career choices. This project aims to increase the number and diversity of biotechnicians entering the workforce. To achieve this goal, the project will engage students and their families in workshops to improve their understanding of biotechnology as a vibrant career and to raise awareness of other educational and career opportunities. The project will target high schools with majority-minority enrollment and/or rural status, thus increasing opportunities to enroll students from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM and in college-level biotechnology programs. This project has the potential to provide opportunities for upward socioeconomic mobility for the members of underrepresented communities in STEM by equipping them with the knowledge and skills needed in biotechnology careers. <br/><br/>To address the growing industry demand, the project specific aims include to: (1) develop an associate degree in STEM with a concentration in biotechnology; (2) refresh the curriculum of an existing biotechnology certificate; (3) increase awareness of biotechnology careers and the number and diversity of students completing biotechnology curricula; and (4) provide summer internships for students to develop employability skills in biotechnology. The project includes partnerships with local public-school districts to recruit students into a newly created associate degree in STEM with a concentration in biotechnology. In collaboration with local industry partners, the project will provide summer internships to help students gain professional, field-specific, and career-readiness skills. The project expects to increase and diversify the biotechnology workforce by engaging high school students and their families in community-based outreach events that use hands-on biotechnology activities. Academic and career information, including degree programs, job descriptions, and salaries, will be disseminated at these events. Additionally, the project will create summer professional development opportunities emphasizing biotechnology for high school teachers and a week-long summer institute on the Harford Community College campus for high school students considering biotechnology as a career option.

2003315.xml,RoL: Control of trans-species microRNA expression,NSF,2020-08-01,2025-07-31,831688,"Parasitic plants can be noxious weeds that attack crops and affect agricultural productivity. The parasitic plant Dodder (genus Cuscuta) is widespread in the United States and is a problem on diverse crops. Strategies to control Dodders are limited. One way that Dodders affect their hosts is by injected short bits of genetic information, ""microRNAs"", into host stems. These ""trans-species"" microRNAs destroy certain target host genes. This process seems to allow the parasite to suppress the host's immune system. This project seeks to understand exactly how the Dodder trans-species microRNAs are activated and injected into the host plants. Understanding this process could lead to novel methods of control and thus would benefit agriculture. Other parasites and pathogens use trans-species microRNAs to manipulate their hosts. Thus, details learned from study of the Dodder trans-species microRNAs may inform research into a broader array of parasites and pathogens.<br/><br/>Recent studies have shown that Dodder (Cuscuta) expresses many microRNAs which enter host plant tissues and target host mRNAs. These trans-species microRNAs are likely acting as virulence factors to shut down host mRNAs in order to benefit the parasite. Unlike canonical microRNAs, the Cuscuta trans-species microRNAs only accumulate at the interface between the host and parasite. The core promoters upstream of trans-species microRNA loci in the Cuscuta genome all have a common Upstream Sequence Element (USE) that is absent from canonical microRNAs and also absent from the promoters of Cuscuta mRNAs. The 10 base-pair USE sequence is identical to the USE element known to drive transcription of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) in all plants. It thus appears that Cuscuta trans-species microRNAs have co-opted a pre-existing, constitutive promoter element to drive a highly tissue-specific expression pattern. This project will seek to understand this process via two aims: <br/><br/>Aim 1: Functional analyses of USE to determine its role in the transcription of Cuscuta trans-species microRNA precursors. <br/><br/>Aim 2: Identification and functional analyses of the USE-binding factor(s).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2000923.xml,Collaborative Research: Untangling the Complex Role of Anthropocentric Thinking in Undergraduate Biology Education,NSF,2020-10-01,2024-09-30,599936,"This project aims to serve the national interest by improving undergraduate biology education.  It will do so by conducting basic research on how the intuitive thinking of biology students helps and/or hinders their learning of biological concepts in STEM learning environments. The project focuses on anthropocentric thinking, a particular kind of intuitive thinking that anchors understanding of the biological world in human terms. Anthropocentric thinking results in a tendency to see humans as biologically exceptional or to reason about other organisms by analogy to humans. Previous NSF-sponsored findings show that anthropocentric thinking may have a complex role in how undergraduates learn biological science. This project intends to examine this issue from three perspectives:  1) How students from different backgrounds may vary in the degree to which they bring with anthropocentric conceptions to the biology classroom. 2) How teaching biology concepts using anthropocentric language might help and/or hinder student learning. 3) How faculty may intentionally or unintentionally use anthropocentric language in their own teaching. This research has the potential to contribute to the NSF EHR mission by discovering how specific systems of cognitive understanding may interact with formal classroom teaching to help and/or hinder science learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will leverage a successful long-term collaboration between cognitive scientists and discipline-based education researchers to investigate the educational consequences of intuitive understandings. These investigators’ previous work revealed systematic relationships between patterns of intuitive, informal thought about biology, including teleological, essentialist, and anthropocentric thinking, as well as revealing misconceptions about biological concepts among students. It showed anthropocentric thinking is more strongly and consistently related to biological misconceptions than other types of intuitive thinking.  However, widespread and frequent use of anthropocentric language by biology faculty in classrooms suggests that at least some instructors see pedagogical merit in such thinking. Moreover, although this project's researchers have found similar anthropocentric thinking and misconceptions among students in two different urban institutions, anthropocentric thinking has been shown to be reduced among people from rural backgrounds. Therefore, this project intends to probe relationships between anthropocentric thinking and biological misconceptions among students from rural backgrounds. It is important to explore in depth the ways in which anthropocentric framing may facilitate learning formal biology concepts (via human examples and analogies) and/or engender misconceptions (via human exceptionalism). Accordingly, the project aims to investigate the effects of anthropocentric framing on biology learning by experimentally presenting biology concepts framed in different ways and assessing resulting learning and misconceptions. Finally, although there is widespread evidence of anthropocentric language in faculty lectures, the degree to which instructors consciously employ such language as a pedagogical strategy is unknown. Therefore, this project seeks to assess faculty metacognitive awareness of their use of anthropocentric language in biology explanations. Results of this research are expected to inform the building of an important and generative theoretical framework integrating disconnected yet theoretically interdependent lines of inquiry in cognitive science and discipline-based science education research. It has the potential to translate this theoretical framework for understanding the acquisition of expertise in life sciences into pedagogical best practices and thus influence the way undergraduate biology is taught. The proposed project is a joint effort between the Conceptual Organization, Reasoning, and Education Laboratory (CORE Lab) at Northeastern University and the Science Education Partnership and Assessment Laboratory (SEPAL) at San Francisco State University, and is supported by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These molecular materials comprise photo-active chemical groups that change shape when exposed to light. The light-driven molecular transformations cause the pores (holes) and channels in the crystals to change shape and dimension. This leads to the development of smart materials capable of selectively absorbing or releasing guest molecules, but only when exposed to the proper wavelength of light. Experiments using ultrafast pulses of light and/or X-rays reveal critical insights into the fundamental photochemistry that occurs in these novel materials. The research establishes much needed design principles to understand and enable the rational design of next-generation photo-responsive materials. The educational projects include the continuation of the U.S. Crystal Growing Competition, and a nation-wide crystal growing competition, that brings concepts of crystals and crystal growth into K-12 classrooms and home schools throughout the country by providing participants a fun and exciting hands-on STEM-based contest.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Integrating the photo-responsive properties of diarylethenes into hybrid crystalline systems transforms these traditionally passive materials into active materials that change their chemical or electronic properties in response to light stimulus. The PIs' innovative approach - using ring-closed diarylethene building units - ensures the reliable and predictable synthesis of photo-responsive crystalline materials. Given the importance of extending longevity in sustainable materials development, the proposed research also includes an effort to identify and understand the root causes of fatigue in these systems. The photochemical reactions in these materials, both desired and undesired, are precisely monitored through advanced spectroscopic and in situ X-ray diffraction methods. These experiments provide a crucial link between the molecular photochemistry and the photophysics of the proposed hybrid crystalline solids. It is anticipated that the design principles and experimental techniques developed through this collaborative research program can be extended to other photochromic systems.

Through surface runoffs and ground water, pesticides and their degradation products find their way into the living world. Moreover, the illicit drug use and the overdose epidemic are on the rise and are also contaminating waste streams. To provide solutions to these challenges, Professor Badjić and his group are making cup-shaped compounds to trap and remove environmental waste and/or illicit drugs from our water systems.  In this project, Professor Badjić and his group design specific molecular structures using computational and experimental chemistry methods. By studying these basket-shaped molecules, he expands the understanding of which molecular structures would be most effective in the capture of toxic species.

2001714.xml,Collaborative Research: Building Geologically Informed Bed Classes to Improve Projections of Ice Sheet Change,NSF,2020-08-15,2024-07-31,174216,"Predictions of future changes of the Antarctic ice sheet are essential for understanding changes in the global sea level expected for the coming centuries.  These predictions rely on models of ice-sheet flow that in turn rely on knowledge of the physical conditions of the Antarctic continent beneath the ice.  Exploration of Antarctica by land, sea, and air has advanced our understanding of the geological material under the Antarctic ice sheet, but this information has not yet been fully integrated into ice-sheet models.  This project will take advantage of existing data from decades of US and international investment in geophysical surveys to create a new understanding of the geology underlying the Amundsen Sea and the adjacent areas of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet—a portion of Antarctica that is considered particularly vulnerable to collapse.   A series of new datasets called “Bed Classes” will be developed that will translate the geological properties of the Antarctic continent in ways that can be incorporated into ice-sheet models.  <br/><br/>This project will develop a new regional geologic/tectonic framework for the Amundsen Sea Embayment and its ice catchments using extensive marine and airborne geophysical data together with ground-based onshore geophysical and geological constraints to delineate sedimentary basins, bedrock ridges, faults, and volcanic structures. Using this new geologic interpretation of the region, several key issues regarding the geologic influence on ice-sheet stability will be addressed: whether the regional heat flow is dominated by localization along the faults or lithology; the role of geology on the sources, sinks, and flow-paths of subglacial water; the distribution of sediments that determine bed-character variability; and the extent of geologic control on the current Thwaites Glacier grounding line. The impact of improved geological knowledge on ice-sheet models will be tested with the development of a set of “Bed Class” grids to capture these new insights for use in the models.  Bed Classes will be tested within the Parallel Ice Sheet Model framework with initial experiments to identify the sensitivity of model simulations to geological parameterizations.  Through a series of workshops with ice-sheet modelers, the Bed Classes will be refined and made accessible to the broader modelling community.  This work aims to ensure that the Bed-Class concept can be applied more broadly to ice-sheet models working in different geographic areas and on different timescales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project at Albany State University seeks to design, fabricate, and test a microwave absorber by engineering the electrical property  of materials that are commercially available and inexpensive. It provides an opportunity for undergraduate students to enhance their education through research experiences. The researcher has established a strong collaboration with faculty at the Georgia Institute of Technology. <br/><br/>Operational frequency or absorbing frequency of a microwave absorber depends on permittivity, permeability, and thickness of the material. This research focuses on the complex permittivity of existing materials which can be enhanced by periodic inclusions of metal strips or patches on the material. Appropriate dimensions of the metal strips or patches are determined by a 3D electromagnetic simulation package (HFSS) to obtain pre-determined material permittivity required for perfect impedance matching between the absorber and free space. Once pre-designed metal patterns are printed on dielectric layers, stability in material property is analyzed experimentally by varying the number of layers. Finally, the desired absorber is fabricated by stacking up the required number of printed layers together and the performance is evaluated with free space material measurement equipment. The concept of tuning the material property with metal inclusions, as adopted in this project, can be applied to design any planer microwave devices such as resonators, filters, directional couplers, and antennas for improved performance and to protect the human body from 5G radiations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During the past four decades, the field of symplectic geometry has evolved rapidly, leading to new connections with other significant areas of research, such as algebraic geometry, low dimensional topology, and high energy physics. This award supports research on fundamental objects known as holomorphic curves and their corresponding invariants and algebraic structures. In particular, the investigator will address foundational questions, such as the construction of well-behaved families of holomorphic curves in the presence of objects known as divisors. This research contains specific projects that can be carried out by graduate students and postdocs. The investigator will organize annual mini-symposia for introducing undergraduate students to research opportunities in geometry and topology, and their applications to other fields.  He will also initiate a math club at the public library aimed at high school students.<br/><br/>The main objective of this proposal is to construct moduli spaces of holomorphic curves for arbitrary pairs of symplectic manifolds and normal crossing symplectic divisors, satisfying particular properties. Construction of such moduli spaces requires a compactification, an analytical framework for deformation theory, addressing the transversality issue, and proving a gluing theorem. These moduli spaces have immediate applications in enumerative geometry, Mirror Symmetry, construction of Fukaya categories, and other active areas of research in symplectic geometry, algebraic geometry, and string theory. In collaboration with M. McLean and A. Zinger, the PI introduced topological notions of normal crossing symplectic divisor and variety. They have constructed tools such as regularizations and logarithmic tangent bundle for working with such objects. Recently, the PI developed a novel compactification and a deformation theory based on the logarithmic tangent bundle. He will use this setup to work on the remaining steps of the construction.

Unfortunately, it remains a persistent source of difficulty for many students, with implications for the understanding of number words by preschoolers and even the learning of algebra in middle school. The main goal of this project, led by researchers at the University of California, San Diego, and Brown University, is to understand the social and cognitive factors in early childhood that affect 4- to 5-year-olds’ learning of the concept. Specifically, the researchers will investigate how children reason about numerical equality prior to the acquisition of formal symbols (i.e., numbers and the equal sign), whether this initial understanding is affected by their developing intuitions about fairness, and how their informal intuitions about numerical equality and fairness supports the learning of symbolic representations of mathematical equality in formal early childhood education settings. The investigation of these ideas will create a research foundation that could lead to changes in early childhood mathematical education. The project is jointly funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning, and by the Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12), which supports the research and development of innovative resources, models and tools in order to enhance STEM learning and teaching by pre-K-12 students and teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers will examine the developmental origins of children’s understandings of the core mathematical concept of equality. They will conduct a series of behavioral studies that will range from behavioral observations to experiments to learning interventions. In one set of studies, they will assess children’s ability to evaluate whether two quantities are equal when they use a strategy that does not require knowing number words or formal mathematical symbols. The researchers will then test whether children are more likely to use this strategy when they are motivated by a social concern: a desire to make sure valuable resources are shared fairly. They will also test whether the ability changes as children learn numerical symbols (e.g., number words). Finally, researchers will test a learning intervention that involves their leveraging their intuitive understandings of equality, addition, and subtraction together with their motivation to ensure fairness. They hypothesize that such an approach will help children to understand the meaning of formal expressions (e.g., “9 + 1 = 10”) that they might otherwise simply memorize and solve by rote. By connecting children’s social and numerical intuitions with understanding of symbolic math, the project will address a central challenge in mathematics education that has important implications for early childhood education practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001059.xml,Interrogating the role of natural selection in the functional evolution of duplicate genes,NSF,2019-10-01,2021-12-31,92656,"Gene duplication occurs when multiple copies of the same gene are created and retained within an organism's genome.  It is believed to play a key role in the evolutionary process by creating innovation in organism traits. Therefore, understanding how evolution acts on duplicate genes will provide key insights into how complex traits and novel forms have arisen. The main goal of this project is to determine the evolutionary forces responsible for the retention of duplicate genes in an organism's genome. The researchers will test the specific hypothesis that the evolution of functional duplicate genes (those that have a new function) is primarily a consequence of natural selection. Scientists have long thought this to be the case, but have never been able to experimentally test this hypothesis. This project uses an innovative method that allows this hypothesis to be tested for the first time. Results will help to understand how organism traits evolve within and among species. The award will have multiple broader impacts on the scientific community by supporting the training of undergraduate and graduate students, development of open source computer software, and dissemination of research findings in open access publications. Additionally, the researchers will design and teach courses on bioinformatics and genomics to local K-12 students at the Science-U camp hosted by Pennsylvania State University each summer. Curricula developed for these courses will also be made freely available on a website for teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will examine the impact of natural selection on duplicate gene functions via both sequence- and expression-level approaches. The researchers recently developed a phylogenetic approach for identifying duplicate genes with novel functions by quantifying differences between their gene expression profiles in closely related species. Application of this method to spatial gene expression profiles in Drosophila revealed that most young duplicates possess new functions, and that acquisition of new functions occurs rapidly. Conversely, in mammals, most young duplicates retain their ancestral functions, and functional divergence occurs more gradually. The contrast in functional divergence rates between duplicate genes in these lineages is reminiscent of the faster sequence-level evolution observed in Drosophila relative to mammals. Researchers will test the hypothesis that natural selection also plays an important role in acquisition of new functions by duplicate genes. Researchers will apply a combination of traditional sequence-based, as well as innovative, expression-based tests for natural selection on duplicate genes. The objectives of these analyses will be to elucidate the role of natural selection in functional divergence of duplicate genes, and to examine differences in selective forces acting on duplicates in populations of different sizes, over evolutionary time, and with varying levels of functional divergence."

The goal of this project is to understand relationships between different symplectic manifolds, and specifically to understand how the restrictions on trajectories, such as those arising from conservation laws, can be translated from one symplectic manifold to another. While progress has been made toward this goal, the PI has proposed the first comprehensive approach. This project has a significant combinatorial component, which is an ideal point-of-entry for undergraduates. The PI is currently supervising an undergraduate research project, and aims to continue involving undergraduate and graduate students in his research program.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the PI aims to construct a single algebraic object, the ""symplectic (A-infinity,2)-category Symp"", which binds together the Fukaya categories of symplectic manifolds into a single structure. This extends earlier work of Wehrheim-Woodward, in which those authors associate functors between Fukaya categories to Lagrangian correspondences. Besides this central component, the PI's proposed project involves three other elements. First, the PI will compute portions of Symp in some concrete situations. The PI has begun to develop techniques for computing the functors associated to Lagrangian correspondences in the context of symplectic reduction, and plans to continue these explorations. In particular, he is working with Ritter to builds on earlier work by Ritter-Smith in order to suggest a strategy for understanding how the Fukaya category changes under complex blowup. Second, the PI will explore connections to other fields. Formulating the combinatorial structures necessary for Symp led the PI to construct the 2-associahedra, which are intricate abstract polytopes which fit in well with several existing combinatorial objects. In joint work with Alexei Oblomkov, the PI is constructing complexified versions of 2-associahedra, which form a rich new family of proper log-smooth complex varieties with a close relationship to M_{0,n}-bar. Another connection is to the theory of higher categories: Symp will be an (A-infinity,2)-category, a new algebraic structure which the PI intends to show is a convenient model for certain (infinity,2)-categories. Finally, the PI aims to understand the ramifications of the symplectic (A-infinity,2)-category for symplectic cohomology, an important invariant of a noncompact symplectic manifold. Indeed, understanding the role of unit 1-morphisms in Symp should enable the PI to equip symplectic cohomology with a chain-level algebraic structure, as conjectured by Abouzaid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this project is to develop new advanced solutions for wireless access networks with the objectives of increasing network throughput and maximizing overall network utilities.  Long-serving model-based solutions are facing severe limitations due to delays in tracking the ever-changing radio and network environment as well as measurement inaccuracies.  The main novelty of this project is to bring new tools based on artificial neural networks (ANN) to meet those challenges.  In particular, this project will investigate when, how, and why ANN-based learning techniques can be applied to a wide range of wireless networking problems with realistic constraints.  This project will pursue transformative solutions that aim to benefit academia and industry alike.  <br/> <br/>Specifically, this project will marry supervised and unsupervised learning techniques with time-tested models of physical resources, channels, traffic, and network utilities.  An important task is to exploit commonalities of ANN-based solutions for a number of subproblems to develop a set of principled, holistic solutions for the overall wireless networking problem, seeking solutions that are scalable, computationally efficient, and highly adaptive.  Pertinent learnability and complexity theories backing the solutions will also be developed, in order to offer generalizable design principles.

Oceans and coastal ecosystems are major sinks for plastic pollution. Plastics have been shown to accumulate in and negatively impact the health of marine life, which in turn places added stress on ecosystems as well as marine industries reliant on the health of these ecosystems. The ultimate fate and adverse impacts of these small plastic particles depends on how they interact and are transported in nature. A critical natural component of oceans and a point of initial exposure to plastic pollution are sea surface microlayers, which are ubiquitous globally and are comprised of natural molecules, particulate matter, and microorganisms. These microlayers act as an “ocean skin” that influences the exchange of mass and heat between the seawater and the atmosphere. They are also sites for microplastic and nano plastic accumulation. This project will study how microplastics and nano plastics interact with model sea surface microlayers, how these interactions cause them to accumulate and transform at the sea surface, and to what extent microplastics and nano plastics will alter the properties of sea surface microlayers. The goal is to provide fundamental insight into interfacial and colloidal properties leading to microplastic and nano plastic accumulation that can contribute broadly to determining environmental risks of plastic pollution and to devising strategies for remediation. Participation will be broadened by partnering with the Northeast NSF Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation program to provide research experiences to two supported underrepresented students. These students will also lead a new middle school outreach activity. <br/><br/><br/>Sea surface microlayers, which range from 1 to 1000 micrometers thick, are ubiquitous globally on ocean and coastal waters, regulating the exchange of mass and energy between these waters and the atmosphere. Sea surface microlayers are also a site of accumulation for heavy metal, organic, and particulate pollutants including micro- and nano-plastics. This project is motivated by the following needs: Representative and commercially relevant micro- and nano-plastics enabling laboratory studies, suitable microlayer systems that are broadly applicable and enable actionable results relating to fate, transport, and nanoscale interactions, and microscopy techniques needed to characterize sea surface microlayers containing particulate matter. Well-characterized and size-fractionated model micro- and nano-plastics will be created by mechanical and UV degradation (Aim 1). Phytoplankton sea surface microlayers will be prepared in a modified Langmuir trough (Aim 2) and used to quantify the accumulation and transformation of micro- and nano-plastics as a function of their physical properties and composition (Aim 3). To realize the broader impact of the project to education, outreach, and diversity and inclusion, underrepresented students will be engaged in research activities and a new middle-school outreach initiative will be created. Marine plastics provide a versatile and timely platform to engage students in STEM activities. The transformative aspects of this work derive from the limited understanding of the role of the sea surface microlayers in micro- and nano-plastic accumulation and include identifying currently unknown mechanisms of interaction and transformation, demonstrating the ability to utilize complex field samples to study micro- and nano-particle interactions with bio-environmental interfaces, and creating a new experimental framework that can be broadly applied to different ocean and coastal regions.

The major goal is to identify instructional strategies that better prepare undergraduate students for doing authentic scientific experimentation in physics labs. Traditional laboratory exercises have trained students to view instructional laboratories as places to do rote procedures that lead to known results. This project will probe how to help students reframe their expectations so that they consider physics labs as places to engage in scientific experiementation.  Specifically, this project intends to identify strategies that help students think of physics labs as places where they will design their own experiments and draw their own conclusions from the data they collect. By working across multiple institutions, the project will provide many examples of students’ authentic science laboratory activities, as well an extensive database of students' work and engagement. The latter will document the rich diversity of resources and experiences students bring from their diverse backgrounds to their science laboratory work.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project aims to understand student experiences in non-traditional science labs, specifically physics, through the theoretical lens of framing. A person's frame is defined here as a stable (either local or more global) set of expectations about the activity taking place. Prior literature suggests that small things can influence the ways students frame an instructional activity, which in turn can have a large impact on student learning. This research project is designed to (a) identify the various ways students frame activities in a diverse set of non-traditional labs, (b) identify ways students shift or change how they frame lab activities, and (c) formulate testable predictions for ways to help students develop stable, productive frames for experimental science. This project is supported by the EHR Core Research program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their evolution stretches 300 Mya and there are ~6200 known species found in nearly all parts of the world. They are central to understanding the evolution of flight, as their ancestors were among the first animals to fly. While flight evolved early, they are remarkable aerial ambush predators serving a key ecological role in communities as predators on other insects such as biting flies (e.g., mosquitoes). Odonates are also one of a few animal groups that spend part of their life in freshwater and another part on land, and so they are key indicators of healthy freshwater systems. They have received much scientific interest, but information about their genealogy, ecology, and distribution is not centralized in any one source. This research is important because it will gather this information for nearly all species and put it in an online database that is available to both the public and researchers. This will be the first such database for an entire order of insect. It will allow dragonflies and damselflies to be used more in environmental, ecological, and evolutionary studies. The research will also help educate the public in dragonfly, and more broadly insect, evolution, ecology and conservation. <br/><br/>The aims of this research are two-fold. It will amass phylogenetic, ecological and geospatial data, making this available for the wider scientific community via the OdonataCentral website. Secondly, this data will be used to study the historical impact of mobility, habitat, niche, color, and distribution on odonate diversification and diversity patterns at the global level. The project will bring together leaders in Odonata phylogenetics, ecology, biogeography as well as informatics and citizen science, and will: (1) develop a robust, species-level molecular and morphological phylogeny of extant and fossil Odonata; (2) amass ecological traits, especially rich information about dragon- and damselfly color, and develop full global distribution and environmental niche information; (3) test evolutionary hypotheses regarding diversification of Odonata, especially the role of color evolution; (4) develop visualizations, knowledge products and analyses that dynamically integrate these three data layers while engaging the general public through museum, web- and mobile-app based tools and outreach. Odonates are dependent on freshwater, a habitat type that is broadly underserved by currently funded research but that is crucial for human well-being. Our efforts will provide tools for Odonata to become the standard as global bioindicators of endangered freshwater habitats in the midst of global change and habitat loss.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They were pulled up with nets, scooped up from seabeds with grabs, and hand-collected by divers, all contributing to a library of biodiversity that captures the state of life in the ocean - year after year, decade after decade. The broadest evolutionary scope of those collections is in the marine invertebrates, animals without backbones - sea stars, corals, worms, jellyfish, crabs, and thousands of other animals. That library of preserved marine invertebrates is our essential guide to the diversity of ocean life across the globe. And because they encapsulate data from the moment they were picked up, these institutional collections also act as a time machine, letting us use the past to understand how our present will become the future. But there is a problem - vast numbers of these specimens are essentially invisible outside of a tiny community of museum specialists. The only record of these specimens' existence is on labels enclosed in the jars with the preserved animals or in paper logbooks on a shelf. These specimens will remain nearly undiscoverable on museum shelves until their core descriptive information is made digitally available. Therefore, this project will create public digital records for over 7.5 million specimens from our nation's legacy of marine exploration, thereby making the immense investment in the specimens' acquisition available to 21st Century biodiversity and ecosystems research. Because these specimens provide a visible and tangible window into our oceans' enchanting biodiversity, this project will involve STEM educators and student educators in the digitization effort, so that they will be able to reflect their science experiences directly back to the classroom. The public will be involved virtually, by contributing transcription of specimen label data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digitization of alcohol-preserved marine specimens has never been carried out on this scale. A major challenge lies in the location of the data: written, typed, or printed on labels in the jars with the specimens. In many cases, that will require opening the jar, extracting the label, and either transcribing it directly or photographing it for later transcription - for hundreds of thousands of jars. The immediate participants in this program will digitize most or all of the marine invertebrate collections at nineteen institutions across the country, more than doubling the number of digital records for marine invertebrates in the U.S. All data will be publicly available through existing data portals, including iDigBio.org, using standardized data formats, thereby dramatically enhancing the accessibility of biodiversity data for comprehensive, systems-based analysis of ocean ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Secure multi-party computation (MPC), which allows a set of mutually distrustful parties to perform arbitrary computations on their joint inputs in a secure way, even in the presence of malicious participants and attackers, epitomizes such kind of secure distributed computation, and despite great improvements in all communication metrics over the last decade, existing solutions do not scale well in settings where a large number of participants are involved. One of the reasons is that in standard MPC protocols every party needs to directly communicate will all other parties, yielding protocols with high communication costs. Recently, some attempts to address this issue were made to carry out MPC with lower communication costs. The project's impacts are to put forth a systematic study of this type of MPC protocols, which we call ""Communication-Frugal MPC"" (CF-MPC), and to advance its theoretical foundations to meet the state of the art comparable to standard MPC. In an era where computation on large data has become a dominant application, such exploration is of central importance in both theory and practice.<br/><br/>The project's novelties include: (1) Development of a rigorous and composable cryptographic model for capturing CF-MPC; (2) feasibility study of CF-MPC with optimal resiliency (i.e., the maximal number of potentially malicious participants that can be tolerated) across all standard communication and adversary models (synchronous vs asynchronous, and static vs adaptive); and (3) improved constructions on additional communication metrics such as message, bit, and round complexity.

2000082.xml,Higher Invariants of Elliptic Operators and Applications,NSF,2020-06-01,2024-05-31,282345,"Manifolds are geometric objects modeling the universe. Geometry and topology of manifolds are often governed by certain natural differential equations. One of the greatest discovery in mathematics is the Fredholm index, which measures the size of solution space for such differential equations. The beauty of the Fredholm index is that it would not change under small perturbations. The famous Atiyah-Singer index theorem computes the Fredholm index of these differential equations when the manifold is compact. This theorem has numerous applications to geometry, topology, and mathematical physics. If one takes symmetries into consideration, then there is a much more refined invariant of the differential equation called the higher index. When the higher index vanishes, a new subtle higher secondary invariant naturally arises. These new invariants have powerful applications to mathematics and physics. The PI and his students plan to study these invariants and their applications. This project will contribute to US workforce development through mentoring of graduate and post-doctoral students.<br/><br/>The higher invariants of differential equations or operators live in K-theory of certain geometric operator algebras in the context of noncommutative geometry. It remains a major challenge to compute these higher invariants.

This project is innovative because most of the data on immediate response to earthquakes has been collected from daytime earthquakes, and this study can identify patterns of protective action that differ from those in daytime earthquakes. Better understanding of responses can help emergency management agencies provide appropriate emergency services to their communities and help households to better prepare for future events. In addition, this project will use an earthquake immediate response questionnaire that has been used in other earthquakes, including a US territory. This standardized questionnaire will be used to assess cultural differences in variables such as risk perception, self-reported shaking intensity, and emotional responses. The results of this study can be used to examine how cultural differences impact US residents' disaster response in culturally diverse regions of the US. Another earthquake impacting the US is inevitable and understanding people's response is critical to protecting our national health, prosperity, and welfare when the event occurs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project tests the Protective Action Decision Model (PADM), which supposes that people's risk perceptions and responses are shaped by environmental/social cues and physical/household/social context when warnings are absent. In addition, this project tests the degree to which households' environmental/social cues, risk perceptions, and earthquake immediate response differ in urban and rural areas that vary in their shaking intensity and duration. This data expands a multinational earthquake response dataset that will allow investigators to conduct a statistical meta-analysis that will identify commonalities and differences in household response across different earthquakes throughout the Pacific Rim.

The ESB region is densely populated, with 47% of the U.S. population expected to inhabit the counties adjacent to the shoreline by 2021. Habitat loss, pollution, overfishing, and climate change threaten commercially and ecologically important marine species all along the ESB. This project will make occurrence data with map coordinates available for over 3,000 species of mollusks that find their habitat along the ESB, including mussels, clams, conchs, snails, and squid. Data from these ecologically and commercially important species (over 4.5 million individual specimens) will be made available through public online data portals. While the geographic ranges for many species of mollusks are well-known, the extent of their distribution within the seafloor habitats they occupy is unknown. Adding map coordinates to occurrence records for live-collected mollusks in natural history collections will provide detailed knowledge of distributions. Because natural history collections have specimens collected from the mid-1800s to present, these occurrence records can help track distributional changes over time and lead to better fisheries and conservation management.  <br/><br/>One hundred million mollusk specimens have been documented in natural history collections across North America, and the breadth, depth, and growth of these collections is exceptionally well-known compared to other invertebrate taxa. Mollusks are among the best sampled group of animals, with some species having over 2,000 digital records available in natural history collections making them extremely well-suited for environmental and biogeographical studies that track faunal change over time and space. However, already-digitized mollusk lots are missing essential data such as collecting date (30% of records) and reliable georeferences (85% of records). This project will generate reliable geo-coordinate data for all covered specimen lots using a collaborative georeferencing project in GeoLocate.  GeoLocate will add layers for bathymetric data, benthic habitat, and marine conservation areas. Incorporating bathymetry into GeoLocate to determine the extent of locations will also provide that capability for complex elevational data for terrestrial species. Important trait data will also be incorporated. For the first time, molluscan occurrence data will distinguish between live- and dead-collected specimens, with a defined vocabulary for traits added to each record. Due to the long persistence of molluscan shells, the live/dead- collected distinction is crucial for all studies of biotic change using mollusks. Information on collecting dates will be refined where possible to increase resolution for detecting biotic changes.

There has been significant concern about the mental health of these youth, especially concerning the risk of adverse mental health events, including suicide. However, research shows that when nonconforming adolescents are well-supported, they have similar levels of depression to other adolescents. For such adolescents who seek medical intervention, these support systems may include parents as advocates and/or healthcare professionals who specialize in serving them. In these cases, decisions about steps towards intervention are made between the adolescents, their parents, as well as the physicians. Findings from this in-depth interview study will help inform healthcare professionals about ways in which medical services can improve for these adolescents. This research will also provide information for families and other stakeholders about how to advance the health and wellbeing of adolescents.  This project provides a platform for adolescents to describe their lived experiences, which can benefit the medical field and families that need their expertise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studying gender non-conforming adolescents provides researchers with the opportunity to analyze the processes that contribute to the creation of their identities.

Data collection involves 60 in-depth, semi-structured face-to-face interviews with three groups: 20 non-conforming adolescents, 20 parents of such adolescents, and 20 physicians who work with such adolescents.  Participants in this study will be identified through a combination of personal contacts and snowball sampling. Interview questions with physicians include exploring reasons for approving or denying medical services to adolescents, how they help facilitate discussions between parents and adolescents, and ways in which healthcare for these adolescents can be improved. Interviews with the parents focus on their child’s behaviors and interactions with doctors. Questions with the adolescents will probe for reasons behind their decisions to seek information about medical intervention and their experiences with this process. Interview data will be subjected to open coding to derive themes present in the data using NVIVO to manage transcripts and data analysis. This project addresses the gap in our knowledge on the behaviors and beliefs of non-conforming adolescents and will provide insight into medical technologies to support them. Findings will also inform sociological theories related to gender and social identities, particularly for adolescents as they transition to adulthood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001906.xml,"Doctoral Dissertation Research: Relational Cultures, Inequality and Belonging: Race, Class and Teacher-Student Relationships in Two U.S. High Schools",NSF,2020-04-01,2021-03-31,15994,"Research identifies minority students’ relationships with teachers as one driver of racial achievement gaps in American schools. Students with strong teacher relationships perform better academically. However, minority students experience more negative and less caring relationships with teachers than majority peers. This project addresses the social processes producing these racial disparities in teacher-student relationships. A growing body of research suggests the race and class composition of schools plays a role: schools with more majority and higher SES students have stronger teacher-student relationships overall but also wider achievement gaps between majority and minority students while schools with more minority and lower SES students have weaker relationships overall but also less disparity. Current approaches cannot explain 1) how predominantly minority and majority schools differ in developing teacher-student relationships overall and 2) how majority and minority students’ relationships with teachers vary within these differing environments. This project addresses these crucial factors through a comparative ethnography of a predominantly majority high school and a predominantly minority high school. This study will expand knowledge of inequality by showing how relationships are formed, maintained, and given meaning in school environments with varying outcomes for majority and minority students. The project will inform the design and implementation of educational reforms through identifying specific school-and classroom-level mechanisms that either support or constrain the development of teacher-student relationships. While focusing on relational cultures and inequality in schools, this project also has implications for youth-adult relationships in other organizational settings, such as in the criminal justice system and the workplace, thus implicating policies in these settings, as well. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project argues that schools have a relational culture, encompassing shared expectations and practices shaping interactions between teachers and students. The project analyzes how seemingly equivalent relationships between teachers and students can take varying forms in different schools with important implications for student outcomes. Through comparing across schools, this project analyzes: 1) how relational cultures are racialized and differentiated by social class, 2) how relational cultures produce differences in majority and minority students’ relationships with teachers, and 3) how students' relationships with teachers impact their school experience and outcomes. To address these questions, this project utilizes eight months of daily observations and in-depth interviews with teachers (N=40), students (N=96), and administrators (N=20) at one majority white high school and one majority-minority high school. Data are analyzed using Atlas.TI to derive coding and themes capturing the similarities and differences across and within the cases.  Findings from the project will inform sociological theories regarding relational cultures, inequality regimes, and organizational processes, particularly for organizations varying in majority-minority concentration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By partnering with a simulation software company and industry consultants, the project will generate education modules aligned with industry needs and provide novel model-based systems for engineering education. The proposal also intends to bring this technology to a variety of learners (online and residentials, graduate, four- and two-year college, and self-learners). The project goals are to address (1) the paucity of scientific evidence regarding  novel learning environments enabled by immersive simulations in STEM education and (2) the lack of evidence regarding the contribution of virtual reality (versus use of simulations on a 2D display) to STEM education. The project will help to mitigate geographical barriers that prohibit contextualized learning for students, companies’ reluctance to provide access to their facilities and data, and logistical constraints that prohibit in-person site visits. The project also advances the frontiers of problem-based learning (PBL) and enables teaching and learning of relevant workforce skills. <br/><br/>The research  design is framed by an information processing approach to learning theory, constructivism theory, self-determination theory, and adult learning theory. Data will be collected from students enrolled in existing online and resident courses for graduate and professional students at Pennsylvania State University. The assessment plan enables comparison of traditional vs. immersive simulation in project-based learning in resident and online delivery formats . Formative and summative assessments will be used to test the hypotheses  and investigate (1) the effectiveness  of immersive simulation PBL and how its effectiveness may vary for online vs. resident students and across graduate, professional, four-year, and two-year college levels; (2) whether the use of virtual reality alters the effectiveness of PBL via simulations for learning critical skills; (3) whether learners’ demographics, personality type, prior preparation, motivation, and engineering identity can help predict learning and workplace performance using predictive analytics; and (4) the relationship between usage/navigation  and skill development using video analytics and analyses of recorded virtual site visits. By developing this environment and comparing it to in-class PBL instruction in a similar course, the researchers hope to better understand the role of virtual and immersive environments on student outcomes.

Ongoing advances in using light for communication through the concept of visible light communication (VLC) make optical wireless relevant to advancing the state--of--the-- art in underwater wireless communication systems. The optical spectrum presents a favorable mode for communicating underwater due to the low signal absorption levels, particularly in the ultraviolet, violet, blue and green wavelengths. Prior work in underwater VLC has largely been theoretical and this research takes a radical high-risk approach to develop empirical models for underwater VLC across real-world configurations and settings. The research takes a transformative approach and explores photo-acoustic hybrid communication in which acoustic and optical wireless communication modes co-exist and complement each other.  Photo-acoustic underwater communication modalities can help advance plethora of applications including underwater navigation, exploration, sensing and tactical communications. This research advances the field of underwater networking by bridging the knowledge gap in building realistic underwater photo-acoustic systems through extensive experimentation in real-world conditions and creates a rich open public dataset. This research maintains a strategic collaboration with the Gwinnett County Water Innovation Center near Atlanta, Georgia, thus expanding the outreach of this work and advancing underwater research using advanced facilities. In addition to dissemination of research outcomes through publications, the research involves female student groups from the university Girls-Who-Code (GWC) chapter in underwater research data collection and experiments.<br/><br/>The intellectual merits of this research are derived along two thrusts executed over a 2-year timeline: Thrust 1 - Empirical Modeling of Underwater VLC Channels. This thrust focuses on extensive underwater channel modeling experimentation and data collection in lab and real-world underwater sites. The data points are used to perform empirical modeling of underwater VLC channels along various spatial dimensions (horizontal, vertical, line-of-sight, non line-of-sight), along different physical parameters (salinity, turbidity, temperature and oiliness), and in mobile scenarios. Thrust 2 - Photo-Acoustic Underwater Communication Feasibility Studies. This thrust focuses on the feasibility of integrating the hardware and software of optical wireless (UV and VLC), with acoustic systems. The research conducts experiments across different use-cases for photo-acoustic communication and sensing, particularly for navigation and tracking and device-device communication. In summary, the key outcomes of this research include empirical models for underwater VLC channels, insights from photo-acoustic communication feasibility experimental studies and open datasets for underwater VLC.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lake Anna is one of the largest freshwater reservoirs in VA. Research is needed to understand threats, manage risks, mitigate incidents, develop capabilities, and strengthen collaborations for our water safety and security. Aerial and aquatic robots will work alongside health and water quality experts from VDH and DEQ to (1) help inform their regular sampling efforts, and (2) provide critical and timely information to guide regulatory decisions.  The HAB is still going at Lake Anna, and it is expected to continue until the first freeze at the Lake. Once the first freeze occurs, most of the cyanobacteria will explode and unload a large amount of toxins, requiring further analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the first report of the harmful algal boom (HAB) on Lake Anna, the bloom has reportedly intensified, and the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) has issued multiple advisories. The most recent VDH advisory (issued on Sept 20, 2019) showed the HAB extending down both northern branches of the lake. The VDH advisories are based in part on water quality data from the VA Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), which collects samples from a series of stations (GPS waypoints where a manned boat is used to collect samples by hand) across the lake. The research team will work alongside water quality experts (DEQ and VDH) to make targeted collections of the HAB at Lake Anna using aerial robots (a drone equipped with multispectral sensors to image the bloom and a device to sample the water) and aquatic robots (a remotely operated underwater vehicle equipped with underwater GPS, sensors to track the plume in situ, and a device to collect underwater samples). These samples will be analyzed for toxins and nutrients, and the data will be shared with water quality experts and members of the Lake Anna Civic Association. Based on 10 years of seasonal toxin data for Grand Lake St. Marys in Ohio, the research team hypothesize that (1) the HAB at Lake Anna, VA will continue to progress and produce high toxin levels through the coming winter months and (2) aerial and aquatic robots can identify, localize, and sample targeted areas of the HAB in the lake. The specific objectives of this project are to (1) use aerial and aquatic robots to target the HAB in Lake Anna, VA and collect samples at strategic locations; and (2) determine toxin concentrations and nutrient loads in samples collected by robots working alongside humans. This information is critical for determining time-sensitive health advisories, and for the communities of people that live in and around the lake. This work will also show the value of unmanned systems to assist stakeholders in tracking HABs in the water; resulting field-tested technology will provide decision-makers with co-robots that can provide rapid and detailed information on the dispersal of HABs in the environment.  The HAB is still going at Lake Anna, and it is expected to continue until the first freeze at the Lake. Once the first freeze occurs, most of the cyanobacteria will lyse and unload a copious amount of cyanotoxins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will build on prior work to explore further the relationship between the quality of instruction in college algebra classes and teachers’ mathematical knowledge for teaching.  This “knowledge for teaching” is the mathematical understanding that teachers need in order to be effective teachers of mathematics.  For example, this knowledge enables teachers to explore and diagnose why students are struggling with a mathematical concept and provide targeted help.  Despite its critical role in US higher education, instruction at community colleges is a neglected sector of instructional capacity in the United States. To advance mathematics education research related to the first two years of college, this project will develop the Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching Community College Algebra assessment.  This assessment will identify the specialized knowledge that teachers need for teaching community college algebra in a way that supports student growth in thinking about fundamental mathematical concepts. The project will also advance previous work by refining the Evaluating the Quality of Instruction of Post-secondary Mathematics instrument, which assesses characteristics of high-quality instruction in community college algebra courses.  These efforts will enhance the research tools available for studying post-secondary teaching at community colleges, specifically in College Algebra.  Since college algebra is often a gateway course to STEM degrees, this project has the potential to improve the recruitment into and success of students in STEM fields and, thus, support STEM workforce development. <br/><br/>The project involves four primary institutions: University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, Maricopa Community College District, and Oregon State University.  The primary goals of the proposed research are to: (1) develop, pilot, field test, validate, and disseminate the Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching Community College Algebra assessment; (2) refine items in the Evaluating the Quality of Instruction of Post-secondary Mathematics video-coding instrument to address aspects of instruction that support diversity, equity, and inclusion in mathematics classrooms; and (3) theoretically  and empirically explore the connection between the constructs that underlie both instruments. The project will use a mixed methods design that involves qualitative analysis of artifacts, item development, and psychometric testing, with the input of community college faculty in all the phases of the study, including integrating community college faculty as research associates, and thus building capacity for future research collaborations.  At the conclusion of this project, two instruments will be available to support multiple efforts to advance the quality of instruction in postsecondary settings and the professional development of instructors.

Continental hotspot eruptions are the soures of the largest documented eruptions on Earth. Hotspot magmatism is recognized in part on identification of a linear chain of volcanoes that becomes younger opposite the direction of plate motion. These age-progressions may be unclear when volcanism along a hotspot “track” does not temporally fit in the age progression and is therefore, out of sequence and at times, off-axis. The Snake River Plain-Yellowstone (SRPY) volcanic province (Wyoming-Montana-Idaho, including Yellowstone National Park) is the classic example of continental hotspot magmatism, and major SRPY “supervolcano” eruptions are well documented. Small-volume volcanoes exist adjacent to the SRPY, however. This project will investigate these out of sequence volcanoes to provide an analog to better identify hotspots in the geological record, yield new constraints on how the Yellowstone hotspot interacts with North America, and be used to help refine models for the origin and eruptive history of volcanism associated with this hotspot. The findings have implications for continental hotspot volcanic hazard assessments. Student training and public outreach are also key aspects of this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A multidisciplinary approach will be employed to unravel the spatial-temporal magmatic history adjacent to the youngest part of the SRPY hotspot track, including field mapping focused on the relations between structures and igneous activity, geochronology, and geochemistry. These data will allow the research team to: [1] determine the temporal-spatial history of out-of-sequence volcanism adjacent to the SRPY; [2] define the mantle and crustal contributions to this out of sequence and off-axis volcanism; [3] decipher the links between syn-magmatic extension, SRPY magmatism and the out of sequence and off-axis volcanism. The proposed study will provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to learn a diverse suite of field, presentation, and laboratory skills. Curriculum for GeoFORCE, a Native Alaskan STEM education program, will be created and taught. GeoFORCE participants shall visit Yellowstone National Park.

2002321.xml,CRII: III: RUI: Effective Protein Characterization via Fast Exact Open Modification Searching,NSF,2019-08-17,2024-01-31,141988,"Proteins form the major building blocks of cells, and protein-protein interactions provide information about cell functions. Characterizing these interactions is made possible through mass spectrometry (MS), a technique that breaks down complex biological samples into much simpler ions and measures their individual masses. Computer algorithms can then be used to interpret the output of MS experiments. The advent of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), also known as shotgun proteomics, led to a huge increase in the speed with which researchers can execute proteomics experiments, which in turn has enabled the creation of massive databases containing millions of known spectra. This research will create novel algorithms that will be able to quickly identify which proteins exist in a biological sample by comparing unknown spectra from the sample against entire libraries of known spectra. Ultimately, this project will make it easier for humans to understand the molecular basis of disease and will enable personalized medicine and identifying new drugs to tackle currently incurable diseases. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop novel methods for protein characterization in MS/MS experiment results that will provide increased spectral match effectiveness while scaling to search the largest existing protein databases and beyond. The key computational component in shotgun proteomics is matching MS/MS spectra against theoretical spectra or actual spectra in spectral databases to identify possible peptides (protein sections). In essence, given a translation of the spectra to points in the Euclidean space and a chosen proximity function, the algorithmic component in the search is a nearest neighbor search algorithm. Due to the large size of spectral databases, the problem has been traditionally solved through a variety of approximate nearest neighbor search methods and a combination of vector space and probabilistic proximity measures which are often not scalable and lead to missed spectral matches. This project aims to address these limitations in two ways. First, it will develop novel filtering-based exact nearest neighbor search methods for the shifted dot-product proximity measure, which has been recently shown to outperform alternatives by accounting for spectral post translational modifications while searching for matches. The proposed filtering-based methods prune much of the search space by eliminating potential candidates without computing their proximity to the query, based on their composition and on theoretic properties of the proximity measure. Second, the project will develop effective decomposition techniques for the inherently irregular computation requirements of the proposed pruning-based search that will enable distributed methods to search the largest proteomics databases of today, and beyond. The project will result in the dissemination of the developed methods to the large computational genomics community and will involve research education of underrepresented undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cells must produce an immune response when they encounter outside organisms and other invaders. Critical to the immune response are proteins in the cell membrane. These membrane proteins not only detect the invader, but they also control how the cell produces a response.  The immune response must be very carefully balanced to fight the outside invader while not producing extensive inflammation, which is itself harmful.  Professor Emily Smith and her research group at Iowa State University are using optical microscopy to study the involvement of two important membrane proteins in this immune response, and to answer the critical question of how these two membrane proteins work together to generate a response to chemically-characterized invading species. A set of integrated activities provides outreach to high school students from low-income families, as well as undergraduate and graduate student training in research and science policy. The overarching goal of these activities is to impart the skills necessary to pursue outstanding science while acquiring specialized skills in protein chemistry and biophysical measurement science.<br/><br/>This project involves state-of-the-art biophysical studies of membrane protein crosstalk and clustering and diffusion  patterns associated with the immune response. The two receptors that are the focus of this work are the Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE) and Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4). Both receptors are part of the inflammatory response in the presence of heterogeneously diverse ligands containing damage associated molecule patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Crosstalk results when the function of one receptor influences the other receptor. RAGE and TLR4 are known to share common ligands and signaling pathways, but the details of their crosstalk are poorly understood. An important aspect of this work is the use of chemically-characterized ligands to study RAGE isomers and differentially phosphorylated forms of the receptor. Receptor nanoscale organization and diffusion are being measured with single molecule localization microscopy and single particle tracking. The research objectives are integrated with the educational objectives of advancing the scientific literacy of high school students from low-income families, as well as training undergraduate and graduate students in chemical physics and data-driven science policy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will provide new knowledge on the regional lithosphere-atmosphere-cryosphere interactions over the late Pleistocene and the Holocene in Northwest Tibet.<br/>The potential Broader Impacts include the development of a new aeolian dust record from the Tibetan Plateau that will fill a geographic data gap in mid-latitude dust source variability and strengthen ice core geochemistry and paleoclimatology research disciplines. Other Broader impacts comprise several outreach activities including:  1) a video segment of ~5 minutes to highlight the inception of the research question, deployment of laboratory techniques, and methods; 2) A classroom lesson for use in high school and undergraduate geosciences classrooms; 3) a presentation  to discriminate the science and findings of this project to the broader community through the Columbus Science Pub outreach program.<br/><br/>In addition, the project will support the training of one graduate student and an early career female scientist (Post-doctoral researcher) in ice core paleoclimatology, mineralogy and modeling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002158.xml,NSF Center for Synthetic Organic Electrochemistry,NSF,2020-09-01,2025-08-31,16000000,"This center realizes a long-held goal of synthetic chemists: to use electrons as chemical reagents in oxidation reactions (removing electrons) or reduction reactions (adding electrons). There are currently very few cases where this is viable at useful scales and across a range of substrates. The CSOE team brings together synthetic chemists, surface chemists, electroanalytical chemists, theorists, materials scientists and chemical engineers to understand the detailed surface processes happening on a particular electrode and develop creative new chemical reactions. The discoveries, new methodologies and techniques developed in the Center enable safer and sustainable synthetic organic chemistry in both academia and industry. Other broader impacts include graduate and postdoctoral training in team science and entrepreneurship and outreach efforts to underserved audiences including refugee communities. <br/><br/>The mission of the NSF Center for Synthetic Organic Electrochemistry (CSOE) is to make synthetic organic electrochemistry mainstream through the invention of enabling, green, safe, and economic new reactions and the demystification of fundamental electrochemical reactivity. Oxidations and reductions are still done with large amounts of oxidizing and reducing agents rather than the greener and more efficient electrochemical methodologies. However, as synthetic organic chemists work toward more sustainable chemistry, preparative electrochemical methods become natural choices due to their high product efficiency, mild conditions, and ease of scalability. Integrating expertise across many areas (electrochemistry, material science, surface science, computational modeling, mechanistic analysis, and synthetic organic chemistry) builds the knowledge base, techniques, and instrumentation to promote widespread adoption of preparative electrochemical methods. This Center has four thrusts. The first thrust develops electrocatalysts and mediators for C-H functionalization. The second thrust develops techniques for oxidative electrosynthesis.  The third thrust focuses on methods and materials for reductive electrosynthesis. The fourth thrust applies the new electrosynthesis methods to complex organic synthesis. CSOE also designs instrumentation and electrochemical cells tailored to the needs of the synthetic organic chemist. The integrated and synergistic research environment offers unique opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. This training is further enhanced through vibrant partnerships with industry, collaborative training with a diverse set of scientists and engineers, and by engaging in community-wide education and outreach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2000394.xml,Collaborative Research: Investigating How to Better Prepare Undergraduate Students for Physics Labs that Focus on Experimental Science,NSF,2020-10-01,2024-09-30,147865,"This project aims to serve the national interest by identifying strategies to support students’ understanding of experimental science. The major goal is to identify instructional strategies that better prepare undergraduate students for doing authentic scientific experimentation in physics labs. Traditional laboratory exercises have trained students to view instructional laboratories as places to do rote procedures that lead to known results. This project will probe how to help students reframe their expectations so that they consider physics labs as places to engage in scientific experiementation.  Specifically, this project intends to identify strategies that help students think of physics labs as places where they will design their own experiments and draw their own conclusions from the data they collect. By working across multiple institutions, the project will provide many examples of students’ authentic science laboratory activities, as well an extensive database of students' work and engagement. The latter will document the rich diversity of resources and experiences students bring from their diverse backgrounds to their science laboratory work.<br/> <br/>This project aims to understand student experiences in non-traditional science labs, specifically physics, through the theoretical lens of framing. A person's frame is defined here as a stable (either local or more global) set of expectations about the activity taking place. Prior literature suggests that small things can influence the ways students frame an instructional activity, which in turn can have a large impact on student learning. This research project is designed to (a) identify the various ways students frame activities in a diverse set of non-traditional labs, (b) identify ways students shift or change how they frame lab activities, and (c) formulate testable predictions for ways to help students develop stable, productive frames for experimental science. This project is supported by the EHR Core Research program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001614.xml,Conference on Homological Mirror Symmetry,NSF,2020-02-01,2023-01-31,20000,"This award supports participation in a conference on Homological Mirror Symmetry to be held at the University of Miami from January 27 through February 31, 2020. Mirror symmetry originated in physics as a duality between superconformal quantum field theories. This duality has been interpreted in a consistent, powerful mathematical framework called Homological Mirror Symmetry (HMS) that has led to dramatic developments in how the mathematical community approaches ideas from theoretical physics, and indeed our conception of space itself. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today HMS is established as one of the most powerful frameworks for building bridges between seemingly unrelated parts of modern geometry.  Traditionally HMS has been incredibly successful in discovering novel phenomena and proving unexpected results in symplectic and contact topology informed by algebraic geometry. The goal of this conference is to highlight the flow of ideas in the opposite direction: from symplectic to complex geometry. The conference will summarize recently developed connections between Hodge Theory and HMS which have striking algebraic applications and give new insights into rationality problems. In particular, the conference will focus on new cutting-edge directions of investigation: (1) birational invariants and gluing of D-modules; (2) extending the scope of Homological Mirror Symmetry; (3) categorical Kaehler geometry; and (4) topological recursion.

2001890.xml,CAREER: Etale and Motivic Homotopy Theory and Applications to Arithmetic Geometry,NSF,2019-07-01,2022-04-30,243079,"This project lies at the intersection of algebraic topology, algebraic geometry and number theory. It involves applying homotopy theory (a branch of algebraic topology) to study arithmetic and geometry,  using coarse aspects or invariants of spaces to study arithmetic phenomena.  A generalization of the number of d-dimensional holes in a space is used to control the solutions to certain polynomial equations. When d is equal to one, this has applications to a program of Grothendieck to control solutions using the loops on a space.  Maps between certain spaces induce maps between the d-dimensional holes giving rise to a notion of degree. A generalization of degree due to F. Morel is used to study arithmetic properties of singularities. This project furthermore includes the design and implementation of a series of four week-long summer math jobs for gifted high school students from diverse backgrounds. During each of four summers, approximately eight high school students will work on an important mathematical problem which has an elegant or useful known solution, learning the background material as necessary, and then creating learning materials for other students of the same age group. The students will be accompanied by a teacher from their high schools. In addition to the work on the specific mathematical problem, career options in mathematics will be presented and support and mentorship will be provided for students interested in pursuing mathematical careers.<br/><br/>Certain arithmetic and geometric phenomena which appear delicate are invariant under appropriate notions of homotopy. Such phenomena motivate the use of homotopy theory to study arithmetic or geometry. The sub-projects contained in this project share the perspective wherein problems in arithmetic or geometry are approached by using Morel-Veoveodky's A1-homotopy theory and applying realization functors. Sub-project 1 studies an enrichment of the Section Conjecture and an approach to proving it. Running the same methods backwards produces results on the differential graded algebra of the absolute Galois group. Sub-project 2 applies an Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence in étale homotopy to compute (co)homology of branched covers. This has applications to the study of the non-abelian Galois representation given by the fundamental group of the projective line with three points removed, and has applications to sub-project 1. The first step of sub-project 3 is to prove a joint conjecture with Jesse Kass that the quadratic form appearing in the Eisenbud-Levine-Khimshiashvili Signature Formula can be interpreted as a local degree in A1-homotopy, where the natural notion of degree is a quadratic form. We then enrich the Milnor number and use this enrichment to study arithmetic properties of singularities."

They were pulled up with nets, scooped up from seabeds with grabs, and hand-collected by divers, all contributing to a library of biodiversity that captures the state of life in the ocean - year after year, decade after decade. The broadest evolutionary scope of those collections is in the marine invertebrates, animals without backbones - sea stars, corals, worms, jellyfish, crabs, and thousands of other animals. That library of preserved marine invertebrates is our essential guide to the diversity of ocean life across the globe. And because they encapsulate data from the moment they were picked up, these institutional collections also act as a time machine, letting us use the past to understand how our present will become the future. But there is a problem - vast numbers of these specimens are essentially invisible outside of a tiny community of museum specialists. The only record of these specimens' existence is on labels enclosed in the jars with the preserved animals or in paper logbooks on a shelf. These specimens will remain nearly undiscoverable on museum shelves until their core descriptive information is made digitally available. Therefore, this project will create public digital records for over 7.5 million specimens from our nation's legacy of marine exploration, thereby making the immense investment in the specimens' acquisition available to 21st Century biodiversity and ecosystems research. Because these specimens provide a visible and tangible window into our oceans' enchanting biodiversity, this project will involve STEM educators and student educators in the digitization effort, so that they will be able to reflect their science experiences directly back to the classroom. The public will be involved virtually, by contributing transcription of specimen label data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digitization of alcohol-preserved marine specimens has never been carried out on this scale. A major challenge lies in the location of the data: written, typed, or printed on labels in the jars with the specimens. In many cases, that will require opening the jar, extracting the label, and either transcribing it directly or photographing it for later transcription - for hundreds of thousands of jars. The immediate participants in this program will digitize most or all of the marine invertebrate collections at nineteen institutions across the country, more than doubling the number of digital records for marine invertebrates in the U.S. All data will be publicly available through existing data portals, including iDigBio.org, using standardized data formats, thereby dramatically enhancing the accessibility of biodiversity data for comprehensive, systems-based analysis of ocean ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is expected that the award will further the faculty member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution, and involve undergraduate students in research experiences. This project at Tuskegee University seeks to develop an indoor data-based tracking framework designed to understand the mathematical and technological foundations of indoor data management.  The project provides an opportunity for undergraduate students to enhance their education through research experiences in computer modeling and data management techniques. The researcher has established a strong collaboration with faculty at Auburn University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will result in the development of a number of indoor query evaluation mechanisms and the techniques to derive the accurate locations of indoor moving items from raw erroneous indoor tracking data. This will improve the accuracy of indoor spatial queries, which can support many indoor high-level applications, including indoor location-based service and hotspot finding.  Novel indoor tracking data management techniques will be devised. The goals of the project are to: 1) implement a simulation toolkit and a prototype system, where many indoor environments and deployment settings will be simulated for performance evaluation;  2) develop and compare a number of machine learning-based location inference methods for accurate trajectory generation in indoor environments; 3) design novel indoor query evaluation algorithms for various  types of queries, in particular spatial query types such as range query and nearest neighbor query; and 4) invent an error model-based approach for indoor object trajectory tracking which is a non-machine learning approach. The results of this research will improve the performance of number of indoor location-based application which will make it easy to locate people and help to guide people to safety during emergency situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001097.xml,Modularity of Genus Two Curves,NSF,2020-08-01,2025-07-31,650000,"One of the motivating problems of number theory is to understand all the solutions in integers to polynomial equations. One famous example is due to Fermat, who conjectured that there were no triples of positive integers X,Y, and Z such that X^N + Y^N = Z^N whenever N greater than 2. The eventual solution of this problem (by Andrew Wiles in 1994) exploited a class of functions known as automorphic forms. When one tries to understand the vibration of a simple string, Fourier (some 200 years ago) had the insight to decompose any such vibration into pure waves. Automorphic forms are the analogs of these pure waves except now instead of working in one dimension (a string) one considers a particular incredibly symmetric configuration in higher dimensions. The most general link between systems of polynomial equations and automorphic “waves"" remains highly conjectural, and was only formulated by Robert Langlands in the 1960s. The Langlands conjectures have since found to have far reaching implications beyond the original arithmetic problems of counting integral solutions. In the case of polynomials in two variables, there is a numerical invariant (the genus) which measures their complexity. The simplest instance of the Langlands correspondence (when the genus is zero) was proved by Riemann in the 1850s, and the next case (when the genus is one) was not resolved for another 150 years in the work Wiles and others. The goal of the current project is to resolve the case when the genus is two. The award will support research training of graduate students.<br/><br/><br/>The main goal of this project is to established the modularity of genus two curves over the rational numbers. The main approach is to strengthen recent work of Boxer-Calegari-Gee-Pilloni who prove that genus two curves over the rational numbers are potentially modular. We expect that the technical results required to upgrade this theorem should also have many other applications in the Langlands program which we intend to pursue.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nanocarbon materials are increasingly being used in a range of applications, particularly as electrodes in alternative energy generation and storage systems such as Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors. It is now generally agreed that the charge storage and transport properties of these materials are highly dependent on the structural features of their molecules and assemblies. The project is poised to advance fundamental knowledge on the chemical and electronic properties of these non-planar molecular nanocarbons. A better understanding of these systems and their multi-electron acquisition and charge transport processes paves the way for their utilization in practical energy devices. Beyond its fundamental importance, a major objective of the project is the enhancement of the educational and research experiences of graduate and undergraduate students at the SUNY Albany to prepare them for future success in a highly competitive workforce environment.  The PI is actively involved in enhancing the infrastructure across the State University of New York (SUNY) campuses to strengthen the research portfolio and to facilitate innovation in nanoscience, sustainability and energy related fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is carrying out a broad fundamental investigation of stepwise chemical reduction processes and multi-electron storage capacities of a diverse set of novel nanocarbon materials. The project's three main objectives are: 1) the evaluation of the structural transformations of curved, twisted, and doped molecular nanographenes with different core topologies and pi-conjugation upon addition of multiple electrons; (2) the investigation of the reduction-induced reactivity and utilization of intra- and intermolecular C−C coupling reactions for the synthesis of new extended polyaromatic systems; and 3) the study of self-assembly and alkali metal intercalation of the highly charged carbon scaffolds with embedded cavities and pockets for the development of new energy-storage materials. The project provides new insights into electron acquisition abilities and reactivity of novel molecular nanocarbons with contorted and strained frameworks, as well as uncovers unusual structural transformations and new coupling pathways upon stepwise build-up of negative charge. By improving the fundamental understanding of the redox properties, self-assembly and alkali metal intercalation processes, the project facilitates practical applications of the nanostructured carbon materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001808.xml,Doctoral Dissertation Research: Regulating the Care Boom: Labor Standards and In-Home Care Work in Three U.S. Cities,NSF,2020-04-15,2023-09-30,15999,"Home-based elder care and other forms of in-home work are driving rapid job growth in care occupations in the United States, in part because of the country's aging population. Yet job quality in these occupations remains low, with median wages stagnating near $11 per hour and worker rights violations commonplace. Such work conditions exacerbate a mounting home health care labor shortage and deepen gender and racial inequality, given that women and people of color are disproportionately employed in this sector. The labor shortage, in turn, hinders labor force participation among those, particularly women, who provide care to elderly and the young. As governmental and non-governmental actors seek to improve these conditions, one key challenge they confront is that of implementing labor standards—a difficult task in the context of atomized workplaces, intimate labor processes, and ambiguous employer-employee relations. This study examines regulatory efforts to overcome those challenges and translate labor standards on paper into improved working conditions. The findings will provide evidence of when and how such efforts impact worker outcomes and will inform policymakers as they work to address this unfolding crisis in paid care work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study focuses on two regulatory forces in the U.S.—labor unions and government-civil society collaborations—and their impacts on employer compliance, workers’ ability to claim their rights, and resulting work conditions in home-based care work. The research involves an individual-level analysis of original survey data, and a comparative analysis of New York City, San Francisco, and Seattle. Survey data provide indicators of worker outcomes across cities, with participants recruited primarily through targeted digital advertisements. Variations in these outcomes will be explained through analysis of public records, administrative data, and 120 qualitative interviews with workers, employers, and policy actors. In addition to the cross-city comparison, outcomes will be measured at two points in time in Seattle, before and after the initial implementation of new domestic worker regulations. Findings will demonstrate whether and how unions and government-civil society partnerships affect labor standards enforcement in the context of in-home care work. In doing so, the project informs sociological theories of paid care work and workplace regulation, advancing knowledge about the conditions under which policy change translates into substantive change in worker outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Archaeologists have studied the Fremont for over a century; however, there is still considerable debate over who the Fremont were and where they came from. This project will address fundamental, big-picture questions about Fremont to help create a new foundational understanding about this group. Located at the northern fringes of the more densely populated North American Southwest, the Fremont region is ideally situated to explore how identity was negotiated and created in prehistoric frontier zones. The academic debate over who the Fremont were has also proved a stumbling block to educators teaching Utah state history. Little information on the Fremont has been published for a public audience. Ms. Richards will work with 4th grade teachers (the year when Utah state history is taught) to create lesson plans that will help educators more effectively teach about Utah’s priceless cultural heritage and prehistory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ms. Richards and Dr. Duff will use pottery to explore Fremont origins, social organization, and identity in this northern frontier of the North American Southwest. Frontier studies provide a dynamic and powerful way to explore how identity is formed, negotiated, and maintained in regions where disparate traditions meet, and will be used to explore the complex blend of innovation and tradition present in Fremont material culture. Using both high- and low- technology methods, the researchers will use a multi-scalar approach to better understand Fremont. At the broadest scale, the researchers will evaluate how Fremont fits into the larger history of the American Southwest. Using attributes of Fremont and Southwestern pottery, they will explore potential origins of the Fremont ceramic tradition and assess whether painted ceramic technology was brought into the region as a result of migration or was a locally produced emulation. They will then use instrumental neutron activation analysis to chemically characterize Fremont pottery and reconstruct Fremont production and exchange networks at a regional scale. At the finest scale, they will explore how painted ceramics were used within villages across the region. Combined, these analyses will create a robust and more complete understanding of complexity and origins in this frontier zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite this warmer surface temperature, carbon dioxide concentrations were similar to forecasts of the coming decades while the configuration of continents on the global was quite similar to present-day. Therefore, this period of warmer climate may provide a useful benchmark to understand future climate change. The scientific results of this research will help clarify the impacts of warming on the South American Monsoon System may have on millions of people that presently depend on it for water resources. Through a series of large public lectures, this project will also increase awareness about the power of climate models for informing on future climate and environmental change. Furthermore, the project will provide content for undergraduate- and graduate-level courses and help grow the nascent Department of Geosciences at the University of Connecticut (UConn). With the potential impacts of this new data and the associated educational components, this project stands to significantly benefit society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although understanding of the climate of this Miocene Climatic Optimum (MCO) is well documented through a variety of proxy records, the continental record remains poorly resolved. This data gap hinders our ability to distinguish the temperature responses between land and sea, and thus, limits our ability to use the MCO as an analog for future climate change. This project will therefore analyze the record of paleoclimate from the Central Andes preserved in the geochemistry, palynology, physical sedimentology and paleontology of ancient sand seas and paleo river and lake deposits at key localities in NW Argentina. The research team will combine this effort with a series of Miocene sensitivity experiments with the Community Earth System Model to test if CO2 driven warming is able to produce the geochemical and paleoenvironmental data or if other mechanisms, such as Antarctic ice volume and orbital changes, are required.

Other broader impacts include participation of the researchers in STEM outreach events as part of their ongoing activities, including participation in the department’s annual Earth Day at Rice University with the Girl Scouts. The project will train one undergraduate and two graduate students, and support two early career researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001536.xml,Digitization TCN: Collaborative Research: Mobilizing Millions of Marine Mollusks of the Eastern Seaboard,NSF,2020-09-15,2025-08-31,160230,"The Eastern Seaboard of the United States (ESB, U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone) stretches from the Canadian border on the Atlantic along nearly 6,000 km of eastern coastline, around the Floridian Peninsula, and along the Gulf of Mexico to the south end of the Texan coast, including 18 U.S. states. The ESB region is densely populated, with 47% of the U.S. population expected to inhabit the counties adjacent to the shoreline by 2021. Habitat loss, pollution, overfishing, and climate change threaten commercially and ecologically important marine species all along the ESB. This project will make occurrence data with map coordinates available for over 3,000 species of mollusks that find their habitat along the ESB, including mussels, clams, conchs, snails, and squid. Data from these ecologically and commercially important species (over 4.5 million individual specimens) will be made available through public online data portals. While the geographic ranges for many species of mollusks are well-known, the extent of their distribution within the seafloor habitats they occupy is unknown. Adding map coordinates to occurrence records for live-collected mollusks in natural history collections will provide detailed knowledge of distributions. Because natural history collections have specimens collected from the mid-1800s to present, these occurrence records can help track distributional changes over time and lead to better fisheries and conservation management.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One hundred million mollusk specimens have been documented in natural history collections across North America, and the breadth, depth, and growth of these collections is exceptionally well-known compared to other invertebrate taxa. Mollusks are among the best sampled group of animals, with some species having over 2,000 digital records available in natural history collections making them extremely well-suited for environmental and biogeographical studies that track faunal change over time and space. However, already-digitized mollusk lots are missing essential data such as collecting date (30% of records) and reliable georeferences (85% of records). This project will generate reliable geo-coordinate data for all covered specimen lots using a collaborative georeferencing project in GeoLocate.  GeoLocate will add layers for bathymetric data, benthic habitat, and marine conservation areas. Incorporating bathymetry into GeoLocate to determine the extent of locations will also provide that capability for complex elevational data for terrestrial species. Important trait data will also be incorporated. For the first time, molluscan occurrence data will distinguish between live- and dead-collected specimens, with a defined vocabulary for traits added to each record. Due to the long persistence of molluscan shells, the live/dead- collected distinction is crucial for all studies of biotic change using mollusks. Information on collecting dates will be refined where possible to increase resolution for detecting biotic changes. The data will be shared through public data repositories, including iDigBio, GBIF, OBIS, and the InvertEBase Symbiota portal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2003236.xml,Monooxygenase/arylamine N-oxygenase activity within a single non-heme diiron enzyme (MiaE),NSF,2019-08-16,2022-07-31,267200,"With this award granted by the National Science Foundation-Chemistry Division, Chemistry of Life Processes Program, Dr. Brad S. Pierce at The University of Texas at Arlington will investigate the factors influencing the extent of biological oxidations.  The proposed activities provide an opportunity to better understand structural factors driving biological oxidations and thus provide a framework for the rational design of biologically-inspired or bioengineered oxidation catalysts.  Oxidations result in a net transfer of electrons from the initial molecule (or substrate) to molecular oxygen.  From an accounting point of view, the ""extent"" of an oxidation can be defined as the number of electrons transferred.  It has been previously noted that changes in structure around iron dramatically influence the extent of substrate oxidation by catalysts.  The proposed biochemical studies utilize an iron catalyst to compare the factors directing 2- and 6-electron oxidations within a single, simplified platform.  Beyond training for graduate/undergraduate students in biochemistry, biophysics and chemical catalysis, broader impact activities for this award include training and practical experience in scientific communication for the PI and students (undergraduate and graduate) participating in NSF-supported activities. <br/><br/>Non-heme diiron enzymes are a ubiquitous family of enzymes capable of catalyzing an amazing diversity of biological oxidations.  Among these enzymes, it has been observed that single amino acid perturbations within the first Fe-coordination sphere have a profound impact on the nature of transient intermediates produced following O2-activation and the extent of substrate oxidation.  For example, within the bacterial multicomponent monooxygenase (BMM) superfamily, the hydroxylase component diiron site is coordinated by 2-histidine and 4-carboxylate (Asp or Glu) residues [2-His/4-carboxylate].  The reduced (diferrous) active sites of these enzymes are capable of reductively activating molecular oxygen to catalyze the 2-electron oxidation of its specific substrate.  By contrast, a small number of enzymes have been identified which contain an additional His-residue coordinated to one of the two Fe-sites; resulting in a [3-His/4-carboxlate] diiron cluster.  Among these are the arylamine N-oxygenase class of non-heme diiron enzymes AurF and CmlI.  These enzymes catalyze a remarkable 6-electron oxidation of arylamine  substrates to yield a nitroaryl product.  The proposed studies utilize an unusual non-heme tRNA-hydroxylase isolated from S. typhimurium (St MiaE) to compare the relevant factors directing (6-electron) arylamine N-oxygenase and (2-electron) monooxygenase chemistry within a single, enzymatic platform.  This comparison is made possible by a single amino acid substitution (L199H) within the St MiaE active site which yields a [3-His/4-carboxylate] first Fe-coordination sphere and imparts 6-electron arylamine N-oxygenase activity.  Beyond training for graduate/undergraduate students in biochemistry, biophysics and chemical catalysis, broader impact activities for this award include training and practical experience in scientific communication for the PI and students (undergraduate and graduate) participating in NSF-supported activities."
2001069.xml,Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Award: Botanical Insights into Social Complexity,NSF,2020-01-15,2023-12-31,25158,"Questions regarding the role of food in urban sustainability are relevant to modern problems of overcrowding and differential access to resources. Archaeological study of the earliest urban centers is particularly well-suited to revealing subsistence strategies that contribute to the persistence or decline of populous settlements because ancient sites provide case studies for examining the timing of changes in food-related activities in relation to major political and social transformations. Within this broader context, this project will use plant remains to investigate temporal changes in social relationships at the household level. Mallory Melton and Amber VanDerwarker of the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB) will study ancient plant remains from two Pacific coast sites dated 900-500 BCE and 500-BCE-100CE, providing a rare opportunity to use food to diachronically evaluate inter-household social differences amid state formation and increasing population aggregation. Regional research will benefit from and work to foster cultural heritage knowledge with results being featured in an exhibit at a local museum. Project members will also work with local residents to create a pamphlet designed to communicate project results to school children and teachers. Excavation maps produced by this project are essential to raising local awareness and fostering site stewardship as both sites are covered by plantains. They will be distributed to local officials and institutions, and a time-lapse video of the maps will be hosted on the UCSB Integrative Subsistence Laboratory (ISL) website. <br/><br/>Dr. VanDerwarker and Mallory Melton will undertake research on the identification of plant remains in household and public deposits to reveal the nature of social diversity and political economy in two of the earliest urban centers in the Americas. Research will begin with the use of a collection in a regional museum, where the co-PI will collect artifact residue and dental calculus samples for starch grain and phytolith identification. Undergraduate students will be involved in the identification of charred plant remains and microscopic starch grains and phytoliths, and the production of large-scale maps that will bring the layout of each urban settlement to life. Radiocarbon dates on charred remains of annual plants will provide the chronological precision necessary to organize subsistence strategies according to settlement occupation phase (e.g., formation, maintenance, decline). Integrating multiple methods, this study will illuminate daily subsistence activities during the occupation of two urban centers of different scale, providing insights into strategies that contributed to their centuries-long persistence. The team will investigate the use of food in evaluating differences among households at each study site, potentially producing a powerful methodology for detecting social diversity that would contribute to the identification of neighborhoods in cases where residences are not apparent in their groupings. The project will productively enhance understanding of the relationship between food activities and urban sustainability while also creating innovative opportunities for student training and international collaboration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

PET is a technique widely used for cancer research and therapy.  The apparatus would be used to make quantitative measurements of fluid flow in heterogeneous subsurface environments with applications to important scientific questions in hydrogeology, subsurface energy resources, and environmental science. This project will enhance scientific infrastructure for research and education. The enhanced infrastructure will facilitate interdisciplinary research collaborations, with a focus on developing new partnerships with minority serving institutions and regional universities. The experimental system and associated research projects will provide research opportunities that will cultivate full participation of underrepresented demographics in science and higher education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system will be capable of safely handling, injecting, imaging, and disposing of pressurized short-lived radiolabeled fluids, gases, and colloids to support multiscale, multiphase flow experiments that will expand existing fluid flow experimental techniques and imaging utilization in hydrogeology and subsurface energy resources research. The experimental apparatus would be mobile and would take advantage of a positron source at the University of Wisconsin’s veterinary school.  Research applications have implications for remediation efforts within contaminated aquifers, efforts to limit nanoparticle contamination of groundwaters, exploration of engineering solutions and ramifications of subsurface CO2 sequestration, and improving efficiency of geothermal energy production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The biotechnology industry in Florida is expanding, with growth that is more than twice the national average. The College intends to expand its biotechnology program to meet this growing need.  Specifically, the project plans to improve biotechnology education by updating and revitalizing the current biotechnology internship experience. Internships offer students critical learning and workforce experiences, helping them to develop essential employability skills. This project plans to improve students’ learning  through internships by increasing the number of internship opportunities, improving the biotechnology curriculum to better align with the needs of industry partners, enhancing the internship experience with an online interactive resource, and developing a biotechnology network to match students with future employers. This combination of cultivating industry partners, integrating technical skills and essential workplace skills, and community building is expected to increase the impact of biotechnology internships, including helping student successfully transition into a biotechnology career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is designed to provide biotechnology employers with highly educated and skilled technicians, thus enabling newly hired technicians to be rapidly productive on the job. The objectives of the project are to: 1) expand biotechnology internship opportunities for students by expanding the number of current internship partners;  2) amplify biotechnology essential skills training for students by developing an internship curriculum that includes essential workforce skills;  3) enhance the student experience by developing online modules to deliver internship information and develop student skills;  4) expand the biotechnology community by creating and hosting a one-day symposium that convenes high school students, biotechnology undergraduates, and industry partners. Additional goals are to increase diversity in the biotechnology industry through outreach and partnership with the local area high schools that have diverse student populations.

2002492.xml,RI: Small: Exploiting Global Structure in Robot Decision Problems,NSF,2019-09-15,2023-07-31,218650,"Some decision problems, like loading a dishwasher or assembling furniture, require explicit planning about a sequence of steps, while others, like grasping an object or swerving to avoid a stopped car, can be performed largely through learned reflexes. In robotics, it is still poorly understood why some problems require planning and why others can be solved via reflex. This project explores how techniques from topology, a branch of mathematics, can be applied to study the fundamental nature of robot decision problems. By developing algorithms that apply topology to optimize, analyze, and visualize large datasets of robot motions, the researchers hope to better understand the gray area between planning and learning. Ultimately, this better understanding could help other engineers develop more responsive, capable, and robust robot behaviors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical goal of this research is to analyze the mathematical relation connecting robot decision problems to their solutions in order to shed light on fundamental questions surrounding the connection between motion planning and control learning. Breaking from the classical planning paradigm of developing an algorithm that solves individual problem queries, the project studies the global topological characteristics of continuous variations of related problem instances. Specifically, it investigates how certain features of topological complexity relate to the performance of learning and planning algorithms. Based on this understanding, new algorithms, topological metrics, and visualization techniques are developed to help exploit topological structure for faster planning and more accurate learning. The proposed methods are evaluated on benchmark problems in redundant inverse kinematics, legged robots, and agile autonomous vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They were pulled up with nets, scooped up from seabeds with grabs, and hand-collected by divers, all contributing to a library of biodiversity that captures the state of life in the ocean - year after year, decade after decade. The broadest evolutionary scope of those collections is in the marine invertebrates, animals without backbones - sea stars, corals, worms, jellyfish, crabs, and thousands of other animals. That library of preserved marine invertebrates is our essential guide to the diversity of ocean life across the globe. And because they encapsulate data from the moment they were picked up, these institutional collections also act as a time machine, letting us use the past to understand how our present will become the future. But there is a problem - vast numbers of these specimens are essentially invisible outside of a tiny community of museum specialists. The only record of these specimens' existence is on labels enclosed in the jars with the preserved animals or in paper logbooks on a shelf. These specimens will remain nearly undiscoverable on museum shelves until their core descriptive information is made digitally available. Therefore, this project will create public digital records for over 7.5 million specimens from our nation's legacy of marine exploration, thereby making the immense investment in the specimens' acquisition available to 21st Century biodiversity and ecosystems research. Because these specimens provide a visible and tangible window into our oceans' enchanting biodiversity, this project will involve STEM educators and student educators in the digitization effort, so that they will be able to reflect their science experiences directly back to the classroom. The public will be involved virtually, by contributing transcription of specimen label data. <br/><br/>Digitization of alcohol-preserved marine specimens has never been carried out on this scale. A major challenge lies in the location of the data: written, typed, or printed on labels in the jars with the specimens. In many cases, that will require opening the jar, extracting the label, and either transcribing it directly or photographing it for later transcription - for hundreds of thousands of jars. The immediate participants in this program will digitize most or all of the marine invertebrate collections at nineteen institutions across the country, more than doubling the number of digital records for marine invertebrates in the U.S. All data will be publicly available through existing data portals, including iDigBio.org, using standardized data formats, thereby dramatically enhancing the accessibility of biodiversity data for comprehensive, systems-based analysis of ocean ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001213.xml,Predicting the evolution of vector-borne disease dynamics in a changing world,NSF,2019-08-05,2023-08-31,2132920,"This project will advance our understanding of how disease transmission will be affected by and evolve in response to environmental change. Diseases transmitted among hosts by small invertebrates such as mosquitoes or ticks (vectors) are on the rise across the world but our ability to measure and predict risk is lagging. Predicting vector-borne disease risk requires both an understanding of how all the species involved are likely to be affected by environmental change and how those interactions may evolve. The transmission of avian malaria in native and introduced Hawaiian birds is an ideal system to gain this understanding. The project will focus on the Hawaiian honeycreepers, a diverse group that includes many species that are threatened with extinction. Through the use of historical specimens of both the birds and the malaria parasite, the project will be able to document and model the evolution of disease tolerance and resistance over the past 80 years. The model methodology will then be available for broad application into any disease system in which evolution is expected to occur in response to shifting environmental conditions. The results will also be used for management of the bird species in Hawaii. The project will support undergraduate and graduate student training, and participation of local high school students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The agent of avian malaria in Hawaii is a non-native Haemosporidian parasite, Plasmodium relictum, vectored by mixes of two non-native strains of the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus. Avian malaria in Hawaii occurs as a series of replicated natural experiments in which vector and parasite prevalence vary along elevational gradients on several islands, and a parallel gradient in tolerance among some bird hosts has been reported. Although P. relictum was previously highly virulent to all of the &gt;50 species of Hawaiian honeycreepers, evolution of tolerance (or resistance) has been observed in at least three species including the amakihi (Chlorodrepanis sp.). Additionally, there is geographic variation within and across islands in host species composition, host tolerance, climate (temperature and precipitation), vector abundance, vector competence, and pathogen fitness. This project will 1) characterize the genomic signatures of parasites, hosts and vectors at different elevations replicated across islands and through time, the latter by using museum specimens; 2) perform common-garden experiments and experimental infections to assess differences in competence or virulence among strains of vectors and parasites, respectively; 3) integrate Aims 1 and 2 in predictive models of the impact of co-evolutionary changes on vector-borne disease transmission under current and future climate scenarios. We will use comparative genomics and transcriptomics at multiple spatial, temporal and experimental scales, and combine Susceptible-Infected-Resistant (SIR) models with evolutionary game theory to capture the reciprocal influence of changing populations."
2001115.xml,Negative transcription elongation factors prevent transcriptional interference in plants,NSF,2020-03-15,2025-02-28,972974,"The genomes of plants and animals can contain tens of thousands of genes, each of which must be turned on, or expressed, at specific levels, times, and locations.  A fundamental challenge is ensuring that the expression of one gene does not inappropriately affect the expression of its neighbors.  In plants, little is known about how such interference is prevented, and studying this mechanism is the goal of this project. The research will be carried out by undergraduate and graduate students, and the data generated in the project will be used in an online Molecular Genetics and Genomics course for high school teachers to help them gain new skills that they can take to their classrooms.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When two genes are located close together on the same strand of DNA, i.e., in tandem, there is potential for expression--transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II)--to interfere with expression of the downstream gene. One way to prevent this interference would be to block the progress of the Pol II as it nears the end of the first gene, so that invasion of the promoter region of the second gene is barred.  Preliminary work led to discovery of a family of negative transcription elongation factors, called BORDER proteins, that are enriched regions between tandem genes.  The BORDER proteins appear prevent expression interference by promoting pausing of Pol II near the end of the upstream gene. In the absence of BORDER proteins, pausing in the upstream gene is reduced and Pol II moves into the promoter region of the downstream gene, resulting in its decreased expression. Experiments will study how the BORDER proteins interact with Pol II to induce pausing.  Studies will be conducted in two plant species, Arabidopsis and rice, which both have BORDER proteins, but different spacing between tandem genes. This comparative approach will help discern the shared features of BORDER protein function across species.  Moreover, because proteins with similarities to the plant BORDER proteins exist also in fungi and animals, the work is expected to have broad impact on understanding how expression of tandemly arranged genes is coordinated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is co-funded by the Biological Sciences Directorate Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Plant Genome Research Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001736.xml,Doctoral Dissertation Research:  Does Speaking Out Against Harassment Lead Women to be Negatively Stereotyped at Work?,NSF,2020-04-15,2022-03-31,15984,"Understanding the barriers faced by women who are harassed at work is critical to analyzing gender equality in the United States, because harassment severely handicaps women’s ability to thrive and advance socioeconomically. This project seeks to build a better understanding of the barriers that women face when they experience harassment. Specifically, it tests whether women who speak out against harassment are negatively stereotyped and therefore disadvantaged at work.  A better understanding of these barriers can help women strategize how to best navigate existing biases when they wish to speak out against harassment. Findings can also be used by organizations to craft policies that take into account the barriers to speaking out against harassment. Finally, this research can be used to educate the general public about the subtle biases that women face when they confront or speak out against harassment in order to influence cultural beliefs about harassment and erode biases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some individuals experience harassment at work, and we know little about how speaking out against harassment can exacerbate workplace inequality.  This project uses two online survey experiments to test for possible discrimination against women who speak out against harassment. In Study 1, (run on YouGov, N=1,000) the project will use a conjoint experiment to test whether a woman who does not fit the cultural archetype of the “ideal” harassment target in various ways – for example, a Black or Latina woman, or a woman who had previously been in a relationship with her harasser – may be negatively stereotyped and therefore viewed as less employable. The project will use statistical tests, including t-tests and regression analyses, to determine whether variations in a harassment target’s identity and story influence her perceived employability, and will use formal mediation analysis to test whether any differences are mediated by perceptions of her. In Study 2 (run on Amazon Mechanical Turk, N=580), the project will examine how a different form of speaking out against harassment – confronting the person who instigated unwanted behavior – may also cause women to be negatively stereotyped and penalized on employment outcomes. This project will analyze the double bind that women who experience harassment may face when they consider speaking out against it. Although speaking out may help to limit the harassing behavior, it may simultaneously damage the employment outcomes of many women who do so.  This project advances sociological theories of labor market inequality by linking harassment to perceptions of employability. It also contributes  more broadly to theories regarding gender inequality at work and in society more generally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000047.xml,Understanding the contribution of individual differences to domain-general and domain-specific components of false memories in both young and older adults,NSF,2020-06-01,2025-05-31,848492,"The proposed project seeks to examine and understand individual differences underlying the occurrence of false memories, which is defined as remembering an event incorrectly or differently than how it originally occurred. The investigation of individual differences underlying both cognitive and neural variability in memory performance will be a critical factor in understanding the sources of false memories across the lifespan. By understanding the mechanisms that lead to these memory errors, we can better understand how to avoid these errors. The project will examine the benefits of a cognitive training strategy aimed at reducing false memories in older individuals. The research will use both behavioral and neuroimaging (fMRI) methods to understand the basis of false memories. Neuroimaging analyses will include univariate, functional connectivity, and multivariate analyses to uncover the neural mechanism underlying both true and false memories. This will expand understanding of factors that contribute to false memories across the lifespan. The research will train undergraduate and graduate students on cognitive neuroscience of memory and cognitive aging and will educate the public about memory and cognitive processes that change with age. <br/><br/>Memory research typically aims to identify how memories are represented in the brain. Aging research typically aims to identify sources of age-related deficits in memory. The current proposal combines these goals to reveal the cognitive and neural processes underlying a significant source of error in cognitive aging, that of false memories. The long-term goal is to identify domain-general and domain-specific sources of variance associated with false memories across the lifespan and identify effective, evidence-based strategies for reducing memory errors. This project aims to identify the cognitive and neural markers of such variance as well as individual differences factors that contribute to false memories. The research will also examine the effects of cognitive training in older adults to successfully reduce the incidence of false memories. To do so, the work will utilize behavioral methods examining individual differences in false memories in older adults, as well as advanced neuroimaging methods to investigate how neural information is processed, and represented, throughout the brain. By understanding both common and unique influences associated with the susceptibility to false memories across difference sources, the project can identify strategies for effectively reducing false memories, thereby ameliorating age-related memory decline.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Progress in quantum electronics, from bendable screens of hand-held devices to future quantum information machines, hinges on the development of materials with desirable mechanical and electrical properties. Recent decades have brought remarkable experimental and theoretical discoveries in the physics of materials. Isolation of graphene, a one-atom thick two-dimensional crystal cleaved out of graphite, boosted the discovery of new two-dimensional materials made out of various other elements. Theoretical prediction of topological solids – conductors, semiconductors, and insulators with highly unusual electronic properties – have paved the way for the synthesis of these novel materials in the laboratory. Some of them are truly unique by naturally combining the properties of an insulator in the bulk and of a conductor at the surface. The rapid progress in such materials discovery calls for the development of new theoretical methods to understand the properties of these novel materials, explain experimental findings, and help in guiding new experimental discoveries. This project aims at building the theory needed to achieve these goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research addresses a set of electrical conduction and microwave response characteristics of novel low-dimensional topological materials. These characteristics are associated with the materials’ unique electronic structure and with the dynamics of their charge carriers. The three specific directions of the research cover the microwave properties of low-dimensional topological superconductors, theory of electron transport in two-dimensional topological solids, and magnetic and electronic characteristics of a class of topological conductors, called Weyl metals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate students will be actively involved in the research; they will be mentored and trained in a broad range of theoretical techniques. The PI also plans to deliver a set of lectures introducing the frontiers of quantum materials theory to non-expert audiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports research that is focused on theoretical investigations of the dc and ac response functions of several low-dimensional and mesoscopic systems with nontrivial band topology. The emphasis is placed on theory applicable to experiments with superconducting nano-circuits, flat-band two-dimensional conductors, and surfaces of Weyl semimetals. The motivation comes from the advances in synthesis of new materials, experimental techniques enabling the high precision measurements of static and dynamic responses, and from the challenges the evaluation of these responses presents for the theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first part of the project is devoted to developing new methods of studying topological superconducting phases. The main goal of this part is to elucidate the joint effect of disorder and topology of a superconducting phase on the microwave response functions of bulk superconductors and their junctions. The second part of the project aims at developing a hydrodynamic theory of electrons in narrow-band two-dimensional conductors, with or without spontaneously-broken symmetries. The goal is to understand the recently-measured tunneling spectra, predict the electron flow patterns in constrained geometries, and find the corresponding conductance. The third part of the project addresses the magnetic oscillations of the transport and thermodynamic properties associated with a surface of a Weyl metal. The goal is to identify the oscillatory contributions to conductivity and magnetic susceptibility which are associated with a surface, but do not rely on electron trajectories connecting the opposite surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All parts of the project are geared towards the needs of experimental mesoscopic physics. Solving the problems formulated in the project is expected to explain existing experimental results, help in planning new experiments, and develop theoretical methods broadly applicable to low-dimensional quantum condensed matter. Graduate students will be actively involved in the research; they will be mentored and trained in a broad range of theoretical techniques. The PI also plans to deliver a set of lectures introducing the frontiers of quantum materials theory to non-expert audiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their evolution stretches 300 Mya and there are ~6200 known species found in nearly all parts of the world. They are central to understanding the evolution of flight, as their ancestors were among the first animals to fly. While flight evolved early, they are remarkable aerial ambush predators serving a key ecological role in communities as predators on other insects such as biting flies (e.g., mosquitoes). Odonates are also one of a few animal groups that spend part of their life in freshwater and another part on land, and so they are key indicators of healthy freshwater systems. They have received much scientific interest, but information about their genealogy, ecology, and distribution is not centralized in any one source. This research is important because it will gather this information for nearly all species and put it in an online database that is available to both the public and researchers. This will be the first such database for an entire order of insect. It will allow dragonflies and damselflies to be used more in environmental, ecological, and evolutionary studies. The research will also help educate the public in dragonfly, and more broadly insect, evolution, ecology and conservation. <br/><br/>The aims of this research are two-fold. It will amass phylogenetic, ecological and geospatial data, making this available for the wider scientific community via the OdonataCentral website. Secondly, this data will be used to study the historical impact of mobility, habitat, niche, color, and distribution on odonate diversification and diversity patterns at the global level. The project will bring together leaders in Odonata phylogenetics, ecology, biogeography as well as informatics and citizen science, and will: (1) develop a robust, species-level molecular and morphological phylogeny of extant and fossil Odonata; (2) amass ecological traits, especially rich information about dragon- and damselfly color, and develop full global distribution and environmental niche information; (3) test evolutionary hypotheses regarding diversification of Odonata, especially the role of color evolution; (4) develop visualizations, knowledge products and analyses that dynamically integrate these three data layers while engaging the general public through museum, web- and mobile-app based tools and outreach. Odonates are dependent on freshwater, a habitat type that is broadly underserved by currently funded research but that is crucial for human well-being. Our efforts will provide tools for Odonata to become the standard as global bioindicators of endangered freshwater habitats in the midst of global change and habitat loss.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2002934.xml,Collaborative Research: The saboteur's tools: mechanisms for host reproductive manipulation by the bacterial arthropod endosymbiont Cardinium hertigii,NSF,2020-06-15,2024-05-31,374958,"Most insects carry bacteria that live within their cells; these bacteria are inherited from their mothers. The bacteria may manipulate their insect hosts’ reproduction in ways that improves the health or number of female hosts carrying the bacterium. Relevant to this study, these bacterial “symbionts” can sabotage host sperm such that fertilized eggs laid by females without the bacterium die early in life (“cytoplasmic incompatibility,” or “CI”). Currently, two common, unrelated bacteria are known to cause CI in insects: Wolbachia, and Cardinium hertigii, the focus of this study. The main goal of this project is to discover the molecular mechanism by which Cardinium causes CI in insects. The benefits of this work are at least two-fold. Bacteria such as Cardinium target animal cell division, a fundamental process that can be understood better when examining how Cardinium interferes with it. Secondly, CI-causing bacteria may be used for pest or vector management. The CI agent Wolbachia reduces the susceptibility to viruses of insects that carry it, and is currently being introduced around the world to mosquito populations, with major implications for reduction of vector-borne disease and the global bioeconomy. The project will also provide engaging science education targeted for under-represented groups through outreach programs for elementary school (U Arizona Insect Discovery and Insect Festival), high school (production of a book “Animal Manipulating Parasites at NC State, and Iowa State George Washington Carver Internship program) and undergraduate students (via research opportunities at all three institutions). <br/><br/>For Cardinium strains that infect Encarsia spp., parasitic wasps of whiteflies, genomic and transcriptomic studies have identified candidate genes that are likely to be important in CI and/or symbiosis. The central hypotheses are that (1) Cardinium effector proteins involved in modifying host DNA during spermatogenesis are associated with the testes, and other Cardinium effectors involved with rescue of modified sperm are present in the ovaries of infected wasps, (2) the role of these proteins can be inferred by identifying the host proteins they interact with and (3) that the B vitamin biotin has a critical role in CI and/or the symbiosis. The project presents a unique opportunity to test these hypotheses with a diverse array of approaches, in four objectives: (1) Compare Cardinium localization and CI candidate gene expression in male pupal Encarsia, the “modification” stage, with patterns observed in adults.(2) Identify Cardinium and Encarsia proteins involved in CI with differential proteomics. (3) Use heterologous expression to identify interacting host proteins of CI candidate proteins. (4) Investigate the role of Cardinium synthesized biotin in modification of host proteins. This project will shed light on the sophisticated CI reproductive manipulation by Cardinium. Cardinium has received comparatively little attention, but produces a virtually identical CI phenotype to Wolbachia with what appears to be completely independent eukaryote-interacting genes, a plasmid and not a phage, and an unusual type 6 secretion system. What is learned about Cardinium candidate gene function, expression and host targets will illuminate CI and symbiosis in both systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Laboratory measurements of Earth materials (e.g., rocks, minerals, and magmas) are used in conjuction with direct observations of the planet and numerical models to help build the rich and complex view of the Earth and its inner workings that we have today. In this project, the investigators seek to further our understanding of the atomic-scale physical properties of several relevant Earth materials through the development of a very high resolution materials characterization technique called positron annihilation spectroscopy. The benefit of this technique is that it allows for direct investigation of crystalline solids at an atomic level, which is not routinely done with other conventional methods used in the geosciences. This project aims to build a new positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy apparatus, test and calibrate the instrument, and characterize the atomic scale defect populations in several important Earth materials including metals, oxides, and silicate minerals. The undertaking will involve interdisciplinary collaborations between nuclear physicists and experts in the area of materials characterization and geoscience. The project will also support two female faculty, undergraduate curriculum development, and advanced student research at a liberal arts college. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding defects in crystalline solids is important for our general understanding of Earth materials because of their relationship to atomic mobility (diffusion) within crystals, nucleation of crystals and formation of new phases as well as electrical and heat transfer properties. When a significant population of defects are included in the crystal structure, it may affect transport properties of the crystal significantly. Many crystals in natural systems may have been exposed to defect creating events including radiation damage and deformation. To accurately apply experimentally determined diffusion parameters to natural systems, a thorough understanding of the relationship between defects and diffusion is crucial. Direct measurements of defect populations in natural and synthetic Earth materials is generally lacking. Positron annihilation spectroscopy is a non-destructive technique used to characterize defects and voids in materials at a sub nm to atomic scale. The technique has been used extensively in the materials science and nuclear materials communities for decades to examine defect properties and the effects of radiation damage on synthetic and industrial materials, but has not yet gained popularity in the Earth sciences community. The goal of this project is to develop a methodology that will enable further investigation into the relationship between diffusion and defect populations by direct measurement of defects in a variety of Earth relevant materials using positron annihilation spectroscopy. The project will also contribute to the education and research training of undergraduate students and provide opportunities for interdisciplinary work between mineral physics, nuclear physics, materials science, and geochemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, this project will use high resolution trace element analyses (mainly magnesium, strontium and barium) and Oxygen stable isotopes from speleothem records located in the South African south coast to address the following questions: 1) How did changes in global boundary conditions at the last glacial-interglacial transition affect hydroclimate on the southern coast of South Africa? 2) How are changes in hydroclimate related to variations of atmospheric circulation and synoptic conditions during rainfall formation and rainfall seasonality? 3) How are these high-resolution proxy records related to millennial scale climate variations in the southern and northern hemisphere? Additionally, this project will identify sulfur peaks in the speleothems that are associated with the younger Toba eruption to link these records to ice core records from both hemispheres. <br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts include generating a new multi-proxy hydroclimate record in South Africa. This record will further the understanding of past climate variability in this region and provide a context for the evolution of plant diversity and modern human behaviors. The paleoclimate proxy records produced by this project will inform the development of a model that reconstructs the resource landscape that people have encountered in this region and thus inform the critical understanding of hunter-gatherer adaptations to their environments.

A common tendency of both nature and human engineering is to seek maximum efficiency in solving a problem. Nature will design a leaf to catch the sun and transport nutrients, subject to the constraining influence of the location of the plant; a soap film will use the least amount of material to span a boundary; humans will design a road system to most efficiently move people and goods from place to place.  The study of what the optimal shapes are for natural and artificial design problems has been a focus of increasingly sophisticated study by mathematicians for centuries, involving techniques from the foundations of calculus, geometry and partial differential equations.  In the past few years, there have been breakthroughs in a number of disparate areas of this subject, but few conferences in the United States that bring together experts from across the range of the subject to meet and exchange perspectives in a single meeting.  This conference aims for such a mixture of ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We list a number of areas where there has been deep recent progress. First, there have been important developments in the basics of geometric measure theory in general metric spaces, both finite and infinite dimensional. There has also been enormous progress in geometrical variational problems, both in a number of areas of regularity theory and in minimax theory for minimal hypersurfaces. We also see deep results in the structure of nodal sets, mean curvature flows and in harmonic measure.

2002463.xml,P2C2: Collaborative Research: Transient forcing of the Local Last Glacial Maximum in the tropical Peruvian Andes,NSF,2020-06-15,2025-05-31,40496,"The geological history of tropical glaciers can provide scientists an important perspective from the past on how Earth’s climate system responds to human activity. This project will look to the geological record of tropical glaciers in the Andes Mountains for a perspective on past changes in the glacial ice extent and how these changes may relate to records of changes in the atmospheric conditions during periods of abrupt climate change. These records of glacial activity will help place the current state of rapidly retreating ice margins in the tropics in a longer-term context that extends well beyond the instrumental record. Finally, by integrating multiple archives of past climates and modeling the causes of tropical high elevation climate changes, this work will improve our understanding of abrupt global climate changes because these regions had much larger glaciers in the past. By determining ages on the rocks that were transported by the ancient glaciers and combining analyses of lake sediments deposited continuously below the glaciers, this research will provide a detailed record of how much the glaciers changed and when. The research team will incorporate climate model simulations to test the causes of tropical climate changes and how they relate to high latitude warming and cooling events. This project will train 3 graduate students, and at least 4 undergraduate students. The project team will improve K-12 science education and engagement by exposing teachers and students (both local and abroad) to research through the GLOBE program (Global Learning and Observation to Benefit the Environment). The team also will partner with INAIGEM in Peru to broaden project impact, and help with the mission of educational capacity building.<br/> <br/>This project will evaluate tropical glacial variability during the local Last Glacial Maximum (LLGM) to better understand how low latitude temperature variability and the hydrologic cycle were modulated by ocean and atmospheric processes. This research has the following objectives: 1) determine robust ages of moraines using terrestrial cosmogenic radionuclide (TCN) dating methods to provide information about both the timing and extent of multiple LLGM ice limits; 2) rigorously evaluate centennial-scale records of glacial flour flux using high-resolution geochemical archives from the recently acquired Lake Junín drill-core record; 3) test the scale and climatic forcing of LLGM climate variability using climate model simulations; 4) test the scale of LLGM glacier variability responses to climatic forcing using energy and mass-balance models. This research will produce multi-proxy, centennial-scale records of mountain glaciation in Peru spanning the LLGM, at a scale and resolution that has not yet been achieved. This resolution will be sufficient to make comparisons with ice cores from Greenland, Antarctica, and the tropical Andes, as well as decadal-scale speleothem-based stable isotope records of hydroclimate changes from the same (Lake Junín) catchment. This will allow for a collective evaluation of mountain glacier archives and other regional records of past atmospheric variability that will improve our understanding of the role of the tropics in abrupt global change events on millennial timescales. These records will provide insight on the sensitivity of tropical glaciers to a range of climate conditions, both atmospheric and oceanic, and particularly how the tropical climate system responds to meltwater forcing. Ultimately, these records will inform how the tropical hydrologic cycle drives glacial-interglacial cycles in both the low and high latitudes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002549.xml,Respiratory Acclimation of Marine Fish to Ocean Deoxygenation,NSF,2020-08-01,2024-07-31,611401,"Anthropogenic factors, including climate change, are increasing the prevalence of low-oxygen zones in oceans around the world (i.e., ocean deoxygenation), and this is especially true in the northern Gulf of Mexico where large seasonal oxygen minimum zones are common. Deoxygenation of coastal waters has serious implications for marine life, including the economically and ecologically important fish species endemic to these regions. It is hypothesized that the long-term survival of species subjected to this type of environmental change depend in part on their ability to acclimate by altering their physiology, a concept known as phenotypic plasticity. This proposal will use a combination of molecular biology, biochemistry, and whole-animal physiology to explore the ability of an economically important fish species, the red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), to enhance respiratory oxygen uptake following exposure to prolonged periods of reduced oxygen availability. Results of this work will be incorporated into public education initiatives targeting K-12 students. The goal of these efforts will be to increase the scientific literacy of youth and the general public with an emphasis on understanding the core principles of ocean health, climate change, and the importance of healthy oceans and fish populations for coastal communities. In addition, mentored research training in integrative physiology will be provided for several undergraduate and graduate students and a post-doctoral fellow. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objective of this work is to explore the physiological mechanisms and ecological significance of respiratory plasticity in a representative marine fish, the red drum, exposed to prolonged environmental hypoxia. These exposures will occur above the critical oxygen threshold for the species, and the capacity of red drum to maximize aerobic scope, which would increase the capacity for ecologically important activities, will be assessed. This work integrates across multiple levels of organization by first exploring plasticity in the red blood cells, heart and red muscle using gene expression and biochemistry, after which whole-animal performance will be measured. The project addresses the following hypotheses related to hypoxia exposure: 1) fish will exhibit an altered pattern of hemoglobin expression coincident with elevated red blood cell and plasma accessible carbonic anhydrase that will work cooperatively to enhance oxygen offloading in the heart and muscle; 2) the heart and muscle will exhibit reduced mitochondrial proton leak, thereby generating more energy per unit oxygen; 3) acclimation will result in increased swimming performance and aerobic scope at the organismal level; 4) red drum exposed to reduced oxygen levels at early life stages will exhibit rigid phenotypic plasticity that results in altered phenotypes later in life. This comprehensive evaluation will provide invaluable insight into the ability of marine fishes to offset the deleterious effects of ocean deoxygenation on respiratory performance. These activities will also contribute to graduate and undergraduate student and post-doctoral training, and results will be integrated into public education initiatives focused on implications of climate change and ocean deoxygenation on marine life.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award was co-funded by the GEO-Division of Ocean Sciences Biological Oceanography Program and the BIO-Division of Integrative Organismal Systems Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their collaborative research addresses the complex roles played in the atmosphere by volatile organic molecules that are derived from plants.  These molecules exchange between gases and particles in the atmosphere in ways that are poorly understood.  Atmospheric particles, also known as aerosols, affect many important atmospheric processes, such as cloud formation, and the Earth's climate.  The research team utilizes synthetic organic chemistry to make molecules thought to exist in the atmosphere and uses them in experiments designed to simulate atmospheric conditions. The outcome of this research may be an improved understanding of atmospheric processes, which allows for more accurate modelling of the weather and climate system.

In particular, pinene isotopologue probes enable detailed studies of volatile biogenic terpenes.  The aerosol experiments provide detailed mechanistic information regarding the formation and growth of atmospheric organic particles, as derived by use of the isotopologue probe species under varying conditions.

While they have been the subject of much study, we know very little regarding how modern electoral parties emerged in our history.  Focusing on the State of New York, the pivot for the first national party system, this project provides a systematic analysis of the social and political factors that structured the actions of those individuals who built the first parties. The project investigates how they formed networks of political support that spanned across space as well as different levels of government (local, state, federal) and traces how local political elites were pulled into the emerging federal party system. Findings from the project will provide greater insight into the origins of political parties in our democracy, and help to inform our understanding of contemporary political parties through greater detail regarding their evolution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While political parties were a major concern of scholars across several disciplines, answers to the question of where parties come from are still almost entirely absent. Progress in addressing this question has been stymied in part by the absence of systematic individual-level data.  This project approaches the question of party formation through two analyses that include these data. First, because in America the organization of parties was intrinsically bound up with the organization of the state and because creating a state involves office-creation, this project will first reconstruct the structure of the larger system of offices that political elites had to navigate. The project will construct a novel database of all civil, judicial, and military offices from the federal to the state and local level from 1777 to 1821 in the state of New York. Using mobility tables, vacancy chain and sequence analysis, the project investigates the emergence of political careers as meaningful sequences of offices held by individuals. This forms the backdrop for the second analysis. For a subset of 730 political elites who were active during the crucial years between the Constitutional Convention and the election of 1800, the project adds information on party affiliation, socio-demographic characteristics, and the multiple social networks in which they were embedded. Using this comprehensive dataset, the project employs a regression framework to study the factors that determined which political elites affiliated with which party.  Findings from this project will inform theories of democracy and its evolution, as well as provide an important historical portrait of individual political careers at a critical time in the development of our nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The region also experiences other hazards, such as earthquakes and heavy winter rain storms, that likely triggered many of those prehistoric landslides. This project will comprehensively map and estimate the ages of past landslides to determine which ones were likely triggered by independently known earthquakes and climatic events, thereby improving hazard estimates for future events. Coordination with state agencies responsible for creating landslide hazard maps in the Pacific Northwest is planned to ensure broad dissemination of project results. An important focus will be connecting landslides that may have been triggered by a prehistoric earthquake on the Seattle Fault to physics-based computer simulations of ground shaking caused by that earthquake.<br/><br/>The project will test long-standing conceptual models for when and where landslides occur within the landscape in response to three main forcing mechanisms: earthquakes, climate, and base level. The main technical goal is to quantify the pattern of landslides in space and time and evaluate that pattern against independent records of forcing mechanisms. To date the thousands of landslides required to accomplish this goal, the researchers will define an empirical model for landslide age that can be efficiently measured remotely with airborne lidar data and constrained by known ages of benchmark landslides. Simulated ground motions from a suite of modeled Seattle Fault earthquake scenarios will be compared to landslides likely triggered by its most recent prehistoric rupture to inform future hazard estimates and constrain rupture parameters.

They were pulled up with nets, scooped up from seabeds with grabs, and hand-collected by divers, all contributing to a library of biodiversity that captures the state of life in the ocean - year after year, decade after decade. The broadest evolutionary scope of those collections is in the marine invertebrates, animals without backbones - sea stars, corals, worms, jellyfish, crabs, and thousands of other animals. That library of preserved marine invertebrates is our essential guide to the diversity of ocean life across the globe. And because they encapsulate data from the moment they were picked up, these institutional collections also act as a time machine, letting us use the past to understand how our present will become the future. But there is a problem - vast numbers of these specimens are essentially invisible outside of a tiny community of museum specialists. The only record of these specimens' existence is on labels enclosed in the jars with the preserved animals or in paper logbooks on a shelf. These specimens will remain nearly undiscoverable on museum shelves until their core descriptive information is made digitally available. Therefore, this project will create public digital records for over 7.5 million specimens from our nation's legacy of marine exploration, thereby making the immense investment in the specimens' acquisition available to 21st Century biodiversity and ecosystems research. Because these specimens provide a visible and tangible window into our oceans' enchanting biodiversity, this project will involve STEM educators and student educators in the digitization effort, so that they will be able to reflect their science experiences directly back to the classroom. The public will be involved virtually, by contributing transcription of specimen label data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digitization of alcohol-preserved marine specimens has never been carried out on this scale. A major challenge lies in the location of the data: written, typed, or printed on labels in the jars with the specimens. In many cases, that will require opening the jar, extracting the label, and either transcribing it directly or photographing it for later transcription - for hundreds of thousands of jars. The immediate participants in this program will digitize most or all of the marine invertebrate collections at nineteen institutions across the country, more than doubling the number of digital records for marine invertebrates in the U.S. All data will be publicly available through existing data portals, including iDigBio.org, using standardized data formats, thereby dramatically enhancing the accessibility of biodiversity data for comprehensive, systems-based analysis of ocean ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2002630.xml,Collaborative Research: Disentangling physical and biological controls on Indian Ocean carbon storage during the last glacial-interglacial transition,NSF,2020-08-01,2025-07-31,182636,"Evidence suggests more carbon dioxide was stored in deep ocean waters during the last ice age and released to the atmosphere as the Earth warmed. There are several ways that this might happen. Carbon dioxide could be released when the total amount of algae in ocean waters decreases after the last ice age. Or the amount of carbon dioxide stored in the deeper ocean waters could change with differing pathways of deep currents.  Recent work suggest the Indian Ocean might play an important role in one or both of these processes. Newly collected sediment cores collected from the Indian Ocean will be examined for subtle changes in the chemistry that will provide scientists a way to document how carbon dioxide moves between the oceans and atmosphere over long periods of time. The social media platform of the American Museum of Natural History will be used to produce short video segments and visualizations of ocean circulation and climate to share with educators and the general public.  <br/><br/>The question of physical versus biological controls of CO2 sequestration in the glacial ocean remains unresolved after decades of research. During glaciations, changes in thermohaline circulation, Southern Ocean ventilation, and nutrient utilization are all believed to have played an important role in reducing atmospheric CO2. An improved understanding of the different roles of biological transfer versus physical transfer of CO2 requires examining multiple water masses in multiple ocean basins. The scientific objective is to reconstruct the magnitude and mechanisms driving carbon storage in the southern Indian Ocean by determining the temporal evolution and vertical distribution of Delta14C and oxygenation (using quantitative proxies: Delta-delta13Cwuel-globo, and alkenone preservation) in Indian Ocean interior water masses across the last glacial-interglacial transition. These proxies have been chosen to distinguish between the rate of water mass circulation and respiration-driven CO2 accumulation to assess the roles these mechanisms played in CO2 sequestration. The use of multiple sediment cores across latitude and longitude has been fundamental in determining that critical indicators of oceanic CO2 storage (Delta14C and oxygenation) differed substantially in the Atlantic and Pacific through time. Work proposed here will fill a substantial gap in our knowledge by making use of the first new core material from the Southern Indian Ocean in nearly 30 years. We have selected a suite of three suitable cores from depths (1,118 to 3,164 m) that are bathed by the major interior water masses that reflect both respiration and circulation driven CO2 storage in the region today. Results created here will be the first from this area using these techniques to determine the magnitude and mechanisms of Southern Indian Ocean CO2 storage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To advance mathematics education research related to the first two years of college, this project will develop the Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching Community College Algebra assessment.  This assessment will identify the specialized knowledge that teachers need for teaching community college algebra in a way that supports student growth in thinking about fundamental mathematical concepts. The project will also advance previous work by refining the Evaluating the Quality of Instruction of Post-secondary Mathematics instrument, which assesses characteristics of high-quality instruction in community college algebra courses.  These efforts will enhance the research tools available for studying post-secondary teaching at community colleges, specifically in College Algebra.  Since college algebra is often a gateway course to STEM degrees, this project has the potential to improve the recruitment into and success of students in STEM fields and, thus, support STEM workforce development. <br/><br/>The project involves four primary institutions: University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, Maricopa Community College District, and Oregon State University.  The primary goals of the proposed research are to: (1) develop, pilot, field test, validate, and disseminate the Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching Community College Algebra assessment; (2) refine items in the Evaluating the Quality of Instruction of Post-secondary Mathematics video-coding instrument to address aspects of instruction that support diversity, equity, and inclusion in mathematics classrooms; and (3) theoretically  and empirically explore the connection between the constructs that underlie both instruments. The project will use a mixed methods design that involves qualitative analysis of artifacts, item development, and psychometric testing, with the input of community college faculty in all the phases of the study, including integrating community college faculty as research associates, and thus building capacity for future research collaborations.  At the conclusion of this project, two instruments will be available to support multiple efforts to advance the quality of instruction in postsecondary settings and the professional development of instructors.  This project is supported by the EHR Core Research program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001743.xml,Unifying synthetic small regulatory RNAs,NSF,2020-06-01,2025-05-31,664519,"RNA is generally known as a messenger to carry genetic instructions from DNA, however, many small RNAs act as regulators controlling gene expression. Over the past two decades, researchers have engineered such regulatory RNAs and have built simple RNA-based genetic circuits in bacteria, nevertheless, the construction of complex RNA-based genetic circuits remains challenging. This project involves developing generalizable design principles by which simple RNA-based genetic circuits can be combined to generate complex genetic circuits. The utility of these complex circuits is demonstrated by engineering bacteria that produce valuable chemicals that contribute to the bioeconomy. In addition, this project provides unique interdisciplinary training opportunities for students, involving biophysics, biochemistry, molecular biology and engineering. An outreach program provides K-12 teachers with the materials to lead their students through lab activities, broadening student participation in science and engineering.<br/><br/>The past two decades have witnessed remarkable progress in understanding complex gene regulatory networks by building simpler genetic circuits from the bottom-up. However, RNA-based genetic circuits have seldom been built by integrating different types of RNA regulators that control multiple steps of gene expression (e.g., both transcription and translation). Consequently, RNA-based circuit complexity is limited. In this project, the investigators first build RNA-based gene expression controllers (GECs) that demonstrate consistently predictable behaviors regardless of connected genetic parts. Mathematical modeling is combined with experimental characterization in order to systematically connect different sensors to RNA regulators. Next, insights into the circuit integration rule are obtained first by quantitatively characterizing both integrated genetic programs and individual GECs then by comparing their behaviors before and after integration. Finally, based on the gathered design rules, dynamic pathway controllers are created to autonomously modulate metabolic pathways, demonstrating enhanced biochemical production. This interdisciplinary project provides the research community with a unified, standardized RNA regulator toolbox for fundamental research and biotechnological applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002483.xml,P2C2: Evaluating North Pacific Hydroclimate during the Holocene Using the Denali Ice Core Archive,NSF,2020-06-01,2025-05-31,391160,"This project broadly seeks to develop a Holocene-length hydroclimate record from the Mt. Hunter (Alaska) ice core archive and evaluate North Pacific hydroclimate variability in context with existing paleoclimate data and models. This project is motivated in part by recent observational and modeling studies that demonstrate a connection between Pacific multidecadal variability and Arctic warming during the early 20th century and since the 1970s. The impact of Pacific multidecadal variability on Arctic climate has considerable implications for sea ice extent and possible linkages between Arctic amplification, sea ice loss, and enhanced mid-latitude winter variability. <br/><br/>Previous work on the Mt. Hunter ice core record demonstrates that the observed doubling of snow accumulation and 60-fold increase in summer melt during the industrial era (since the year 1850) is linked to Pacific multidecadal variability and is unique in the last millennium.  The research seeks to confirm if the same drivers are relevant for the entire Holocene. Establishing how the Pacific-Arctic teleconnection responded during warm intervals and abrupt events outside of the instrumental period and last millennium would provide valuable insight into Earth system sensitivity.<br/><br/>The researchers will combine several complementary techniques in different sections of the Mt. Hunter ice core archive, with specific focus on the bottom 20 meters of the twin 208-meter surface-to-bedrock cores. Preliminary radiogenic isotope (14-Carbon) analyses demonstrate that the basal ice is more than 10,000 years old.  <br/><br/>Specific project objectives include: 1) time scale development using additional 14-Carbon measurements, tephrochronology, laser ablation ICPMS measurements to extend annual layer counting, and a suite of glaciological models; 2) hydroclimate proxy development, including snow accumulation for regional moisture estimates (based on chronology and ice flow models), stable water isotopes for the integrated water cycle, and trace element chemistry for atmospheric dynamics; 3) integration with the new Holocene-length Mt. Hunter record with the existing North Pacific ice core array and other regional paleoclimate data; and 4) comparison of the new Holocene-length Mt. Hunter record with Earth system models.<br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts include a multi-faceted approach that includes support and mentoring of an early career scientist and a doctoral student in the context of international research cooperation.  The researchers will collaborate with Colorado State University faculty and U.S. National Park Service faculty personnel to fabricate educational kits based on the Mt. Hunter ice core record that target grades 4-12 education in Alaska and Maine schools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001349.xml,Groups and Arithmetic Geometry,NSF,2020-07-01,2024-06-30,216000,"The principal investigator's research explores the connections between three of the central concepts in algebra: groups, fields, and varieties. Groups are symmetry types; for instance, all bilaterally symmetric animals share a symmetry group, which is different  from the symmetry group of a starfish.  Fields are systems of numbers which can be added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided; for instance, the usual real numbers form a field, but the rational numbers, which can be expressed as fractions, form a smaller field of particular interest to number theorists.  Varieties are systems of simultaneous equations in a number of variables.  The PI is trying to understand the deep connections between these three concepts.  For instance, simple groups, the building blocks for all finite groups, can almost always be expressed essentially as the points of a variety over a finite field. Varieties determine fields whose symmetry groups have been of interest in mathematics for more than 200 years, when Gauss gave a compass and straightedge construction for the regular 17-gon. This project also provides research training opportunities for graduate students working with the PI on these questions.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project involves using group theory to describe the images of Galois representations arising either from varieties or from automorphic forms.  Problems of this kind can often be approached via by what might be termed the ""inverse problem"" in invariant theory, recognizing an algebraic group from data about its representation category.  Group theory and algebraic geometry can be applied together to analyze the Galois action on Mordell-Weil groups of abelian varieties over Galois extensions. In a different direction, the project involves using algebraic geometry, alone or in combination with character-theoretic methods, to solve problems about finite simple groups. In particular, these tools can be applied to investigate word maps, defined by elements in free groups or related objects such as surface groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, this study examines local food security programs that share commonalities with social movements for food sovereignty.  This study asks what role development programs play in both challenging and maintaining the current food system.  By providing a detailed account of food security programs and their effects, this study will add a deeper understanding of the way that food security efforts unfold in practice, their unintended results and opportunities to intersect with more transformative projects. By evaluating the possibility of development institutions to be involved in efforts to attain food sovereignty, it will be of interest to decision makers and development professionals.  Findings from this project will inform future directions of food security efforts in food insecure regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During five months of field work, interviews and ethnographic observation will be conducted with development agency program officers, non-governmental organization field staff, food program participants, and food sovereignty advocates.  Eighty interviews will be conducted in total.  Data will be analyzed using an iterative process to understand the landscape of food sovereignty and food security interventions, the origins of atypical food security programs, and the effects these programs have in practice. Findings will shed light on the changing landscape of food security decisions and how these changes can be understood within the broader food system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2003208.xml,Chemical Tools to Probe the Activation of Bacterial Signaling,NSF,2020-05-01,2024-04-30,243000,"Bacteria can sense and respond to the world around them. For example, a microbe in a hostile environment activates mechanisms of defense. However, it is not well understood how bacteria are able to differentiate between the many chemical stimuli that they encounter and respond accordingly. Professors Carlson and Goodpaster of the University of Minnesota uses chemical synthesis and biochemical methods to gain an understanding of the response pathways that bacteria use and how their responses are customized to a variety of environmental conditions, such as high temperature, low nutrients, or the presence of chemical compounds, such as antibiotics. This knowledge ultimately enables us to control the behaviors of bacteria to our advantage, including for the production of biofuels or natural products that can be used as drugs. A collection of educational activities introduces students, especially girls from low socioeconomic groups and diverse backgrounds, to the roles that microbes play in our lives. These efforts include interactions with the same cohort of girls and young women over multiple years, encouraging them to see themselves as scientists in their future careers. This program also provides opportunities for graduate students to mentor and teach students starting from age six and generates materials that are broadly disseminated to enable others to teach young students about bacteria and their many functions on our lives, both bad and good. <br/><br/><br/>With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program is funding Professors Carlson and Goodpaster at the University of Minnesota to study how microbes translate the complex environment in which they live into the actions required to survive and thrive. Essential to this capability are the two-component system (TCSs), which consist of a histidine kinase and response regulator protein pair. A single organism possesses tens to hundreds of individual TCSs, each reacting with high sensitivity and selectivity to one or a small number of chemical signals. Each chemical message is converted into a defined bacterial action, ranging from growth, motility, biosynthesis of natural products, and pathogenesis. Although numerous individual TCSs have been studied, current methodologies do not enable global assessment of the conditions under which many of them are induced, characterization of the relationship between TCS signal transduction and phenotypic results, or the regulation of response between multiple TCSs. A deeper understanding of TCS-mediated signaling is achieved by: 1) Synthesis and evaluation of molecules to develop an understanding of how to internalize phosphate-containing molecules into bacteria, and 2) Develop chemical proteomics methodologies to pair TCSs with their stimulating molecule(s) and to globally map HK activation by environmental stressors in live cells. The overarching goal is to define the suite of TCSs that are required for a generic stress response and those that are stimulus-specific. This information promotes a deeper understanding of how bacteria are able to utilize their relatively limited genome to orchestrate response to nearly limitless stimuli. This goal is aligned with one of the NSF 10 Big Ideas, Understanding the Rules of Life.  A set of rules that predict an organism's observable characteristics and its phenotype, as it relates to the roles of the TCSs, is elucidated.  These research goals are complemented with educational and outreach activities, focused on girls from low socioeconomic groups and diverse backgrounds, that introduce them to the roles that microbes play in our everyday lives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2003117.xml,Manipulating the strong quantum spin fluctuations in triple perovskites with effective spin-1/2 triangular lattice,NSF,2020-08-01,2026-07-31,700000,"Non-technical Abstract:<br/>While the rise of quantum computers may one day help solve complex problems and deliver information with unhackable security, there is lack of a material platforms for scalable realization of quantum technologies. For instance, the most interesting magnetic property of the celebrated quantum spin liquids (QSLs) is the possibility of quantum mechanical encryption and transport of information, protected against environmental influences. Despite extensive studies on QSLs, they are still far away from applications. First obstacle is the shortage of understanding of this new phase of matter. The common belief is that the strong quantum spin fluctuations (QSFs) play a critical role in QSLs but how exactly QSFs lead to QSL state or other exotic quantum magnetic phenomena is not clear. Second obstacle is that most of the studied QSLs are insulators and electronically inert, which is incompatible with an electrical circuit that relies on moving charge carriers. The grand challenge is to find a way to convert the entanglement information into mobile charge signal by “metallizing” quantum magnets. This project will take a unique approach by using strategical materials design to address these two obstacles. The project also will support the education and activities of two graduate students. The principal investigator’s educational effort is to attract undergraduate and high school students to the real world of science and technology and to motivate them to pursue careers in science by bridging the gap between research and educational settings. The main activities include: (i) bringing the lab to the classroom by integrating the exposure to the PI’s research program and research facility into existing undergraduate courses; (ii) bringing the classroom to the lab by developing a summer seminar; (iii) reach out to high school students through the Governor Summer School of the Tennessee state.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>This project will focus on triple perovskites A3BC2O9, in which the effective spin-1/2 magnetic ions form a two-dimensional equilateral triangular lattice. Therefore, this system fits all the requirements for maximized QSFs.  The chemical substitution on A sites or C sites can easily introduce perturbations, such as anisotropy and quenched disorder into the system. Moreover, the PI also can use its “sandwich” structure, by combining high pressure, to explore the metallization of quantum magnets. The approach includes (i) crystal growth of the new triple perovskites; (ii) studies on how the QSFs react to the perturbations and how the physical properties of the sandwich structure involve under high pressure by complementary low temperature, high magnetic field, and high pressure measurements, including AC susceptibility, specific heat, thermal conductivity, resistivity, elastic and inelastic neutron scattering, and total scattering for pair distribution function (PDF).  The expected outcomes will provide (i) new QSL candidates and guidelines for new QSL search; (ii) a new direction for metallizing quantum magnets and fundamental knowledge about how the itinerant electrons interact with quantum spin states.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is the premier international conference for researchers in agents and multi-agent systems (MAS) across a fully international research community.  This consortium is oriented on research and career development for students who have identified their PhD topics and are just embarking on that independent research. The central activities for the DMC include opportunities for students to present and discuss their work with their peers; interaction with an identified group of senior researchers for advice on Ph.D. research, a career panel to discuss career choices in industry and academia, small group activities led by assigned mentors, and a great deal of opportunity for interactions with the international research community in AAMAS, which might lead to future collaborative activity. In addition, the DMC includes a tutorial program with full-day and half-day tutorials that will provide detailed overviews of specific subfields by leading researchers in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sponsoring student travel to AAMAS conveys many benefits beyond the DMC program. The sponsored students have full access to a well-developed AAMAS workshop and conference program covering a diverse range of research areas in this community. This is an opportunity for students to engage in discussion with scientists from around the world and to explore new research directions and topics. AAMAS is the major international conference that will figure prominently in the research careers of students who remain involved in agents and MAS. Students gain valuable research insights from the exchange of technical ideas in this broader venue. In the process, they make valuable connections with potential collaborators from around the world.

This research project includes developing a reliable technique for depositing thin layers of gallium oxide, a semiconductor. This material is interesting because it has shown promise for many special defense and civilian electronic device applications, including high power microelectronic devices and harsh environment sensors. Undergraduate students with very little or no prior research experience will learn technological skills by conducting research during the regular academic year and in the summer. Five talented High School students from neighboring schools in rural northeastern North Carolina will be introduced to materials research careers each year during the summer research internship supported with this grant.

Low energy laser Multi-Charge Ion (MCI) implantation used to heavily dope the top layer of the material at selected spatial locations will also be investigated. The principal investigator and student researchers will work with the co-investigator and graduate students at Old Dominion University to study MCI implantation and efficient dopant activation processes. The ultra-wide energy gap of this material implies high breakdown field strength and high tolerance for extreme conditions and harsh environments.

Professor Lippert will conduct research into these systems with the goal of developing interdisciplinary connections between string theory and gravitational physics, nuclear physics, astrophysics, and condensed matter physics. Such bridges enable the exchange of ideas and techniques between different fields of physics, enriching and advancing them all.

2002817.xml,Collaborative Proposal: Impact of a colloidal suspension droplet: suspension flows at extreme shear rates,NSF,2020-08-01,2024-02-29,225795,"Non-technical Abstract:<br/>An impacting liquid drop is not only an eye-catching phenomenon, it is also an ideal testbed for studying material properties.  This is due to the high speed at which an impacting drop spreads out (up to 10 m/s); this spreading process has been carefully studied in ordinary fluids, but little work has been done to understand how this impact behavior is modified in a complex fluid.  Complex fluids such as ketchup, paint, and oobleck (cornstarch-in-water) have the property that their viscosity (resistance to flow) depends on the applied stress.  Thus, these fluids flow quite differently depending on the stress they experience.  This research project explores how this stress-dependent viscosity alters drop-impact behavior.  Complex fluids are ubiquitous, and a deeper understanding of their behavior in impact processes is essential to industries such as food and drug processing, additive manufacturing, and printing/coating. In addition to the research synergy between PI Driscoll and Co-PI Cheng, the collaboration allows a unique opportunity for expanding students’ training:  a personnel exchange has been implemented, so that the students involved in the project spend two weeks each year at their non-home institution. This personnel exchange provides trainees opportunities to connect with a larger network of scientists, as well as the experience of another discipline and institution. Additionally, the research team leverages the stunning and eye-catching phenomena of drop impact to design demos to educate the broader public about the fascinating properties of complex fluids. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Liquid drop impact is a classic problem in fluid mechanics and soft materials and has been studied extensively for many decades. In comparison, studies focusing on the impact of non-Newtonian fluid droplets, particularly suspension droplets, have been few and far between, even though such processes are essential in industries such as food and drug processing, additive manufacturing, and printing/coating. This project addresses this knowledge gap by conducting an extensive study of impacting colloidal suspension droplets, providing a full understanding of the dynamics of suspension-drop impact and drawing a direct comparison between Newtonian and non-Newtonian drop impact processes. This systematic study varies control parameters such as suspension volume fraction, particle shape, impact energy, and target size.  Using both advanced imaging techniques, as well as new tools to measure impact forces and stress distributions, the team aims to fully characterize both the kinematics and dynamics of impacting suspension droplets. Suspension-drop impact provides an ideal model system to probe suspension dynamics under complex and extreme conditions: a spreading droplet generates shear rates at least an order of magnitude higher than those that are accessible via standard rheometry. In addition, the isolated air-fluid interface in drop impact imposes a unique open boundary rarely seen in other circumstances. Thus, this project provides crucial missing information on suspension dynamics under extreme conditions, complementary to the current understanding of suspension flows obtained in conventional bulk rheological tests.<br/><br/>This Division of Materials Research (DMR) grant supports research to study impacting colloidal suspension droplets between Newtonian and non-Newtonian drop impact processes with funding from the Condensed Matter Physics (CMP) Program in DMR of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Having led to the solution of a number of outstanding conjectures, such as Fermat's Last Theorem and the Mordell Conjecture, it continues to give rise to deep and important problems in algebra. Local-global principles are a central theme in this interplay of subjects, and many important outstanding problems can be expressed in terms of such principles. This project has the objective of understanding local-global principles and their obstructions, in contexts that are broader than those considered in number theory. The project will also support and enhance the training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers through seminars, conferences and workshops, and mentoring activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Focused Research Group will focus on local-global principles for algebraic structures defined over function fields of curves over base fields such as p-adic fields, with a longer term goal of treating the case of function fields of curves over global fields. The obstructions to such local-global principles can often be formulated in terms of cohomology. Our project aims to study the finiteness of these obstructions and determine criteria for them to vanish. The resulting understanding will be applied to proving conjectures and solving open problems concerning algebraic structures such as quadratic forms and associative algebras. This will include situations that have been studied by many researchers but where solutions had previously seemed out of reach. Research methods will include field patching, cohomological methods including residues and duality, and approaches from geometry."

They were pulled up with nets, scooped up from seabeds with grabs, and hand-collected by divers, all contributing to a library of biodiversity that captures the state of life in the ocean - year after year, decade after decade. The broadest evolutionary scope of those collections is in the marine invertebrates, animals without backbones - sea stars, corals, worms, jellyfish, crabs, and thousands of other animals. That library of preserved marine invertebrates is our essential guide to the diversity of ocean life across the globe. And because they encapsulate data from the moment they were picked up, these institutional collections also act as a time machine, letting us use the past to understand how our present will become the future. But there is a problem - vast numbers of these specimens are essentially invisible outside of a tiny community of museum specialists. The only record of these specimens' existence is on labels enclosed in the jars with the preserved animals or in paper logbooks on a shelf. These specimens will remain nearly undiscoverable on museum shelves until their core descriptive information is made digitally available. Therefore, this project will create public digital records for over 7.5 million specimens from our nation's legacy of marine exploration, thereby making the immense investment in the specimens' acquisition available to 21st Century biodiversity and ecosystems research. Because these specimens provide a visible and tangible window into our oceans' enchanting biodiversity, this project will involve STEM educators and student educators in the digitization effort, so that they will be able to reflect their science experiences directly back to the classroom. The public will be involved virtually, by contributing transcription of specimen label data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digitization of alcohol-preserved marine specimens has never been carried out on this scale. A major challenge lies in the location of the data: written, typed, or printed on labels in the jars with the specimens.

The immediate participants in this program will digitize most or all of the marine invertebrate collections at nineteen institutions across the country, more than doubling the number of digital records for marine invertebrates in the U.S. All data will be publicly available through existing data portals, including iDigBio.org, using standardized data formats, thereby dramatically enhancing the accessibility of biodiversity data for comprehensive, systems-based analysis of ocean ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001548.xml,PEN: Digitization: Enhancing LepNet: Digitization and integration of significant butterfly and moth collections from the upper Midwest Tension Zone region,NSF,2020-09-15,2024-08-31,174647,"Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) are one of the most diverse groups of organisms on the planet: worldwide there are approximately 160,000 species, including around 14,300 species in North America. Moths and butterflies are a conspicuous component of terrestrial habitats and one of the most diverse groups of plant-feeding animals worldwide. This insect group includes species of great economic importance. Their juveniles feed on plants useful to humans, including grains, cotton, tobacco, and timber and shade trees. However, many of the adults are beneficial as pollinators and are icons of conservation as evidenced by Monarch butterflies. Given their economic importance and sheer beauty, butterflies and moths are one of the most abundant insect group in museum collections, but only a fraction of the approximately 15 million specimens in non-federal collections have had their specimen label information digitally recorded and accessible to researchers and educators. This award will allow the Wisconsin Insect Research Collection (WIRC) at UW-Madison to join with the Lepidoptera of North America Network Thematic Collection Network (LepNet TCN) as a Partner to Existing Network (PEN). A floristic “Tension Zone” separating temperate and sub-boreal biota passes through the Great Lake Region; Wisconsin contains a greater portion of this zone than any other state in which it is found. The majority of Lepidoptera specimens in the WIRC were collected in Wisconsin and their data will thus fill a significant and critical gap in our knowledge of Lepidoptera species in the upper Midwestern United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide digitized and georeferenced data for nearly 70,000 North American Lepidoptera specimens. Currently, Wisconsin records for Lepidoptera are scarce in the LepNet SCAN portal. Inclusion of the WIRC dataset will significantly increase the number of species-level occurrences for the Great Lake Tension Zone region for most Lepidoptera superfamilies, greatly enhancing the target number of species for ecological niche modeling. Project personnel will develop and implement a workflow that involves transcribing data to add new specimen records to the WIRC’s existing Specify database. These data will be available through the LepNet SCAN portal, iDigBio.org, and GBIF.org, where they can be accessed for research, education, and public use. High-resolution images will also be generated for about 1,500 adult exemplar specimens for Lepidoptera species in and around the upper Midwest tension zone. Participating undergraduate and graduate students, as well as interns and volunteers, will be trained and mentored in databasing workflows, specimen curation, imaging, and collections-based research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The data will include information about students who completed the program, who did not complete the program, and who changed programs or transferred to other institutions.  These data will be analyzed to identify potential pathways and critical junctions that may lead to student success or other outcomes. The research team from Tallahassee Community College and Florida State University expect that this approach will reveal opportunities and hindrances students face as they pursue credentials in information technology. &lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;This project aims to test the potential of integrating institutional data with phenomenological data to model student progression through post-secondary STEM programs, specifically information technology.  Framed by Tinto’s model of student attrition and persistence, it will use a mixed methods sequential exploratory design with multiple layers of data collection and analyses that merge and examine institutional data and alumni phenomenological experiential data.  It expects that this analysis will identify and verify influencers that support or hinder student success. Quantitative data analyses will consist of descriptive and comparative methods, which will be verified and informed by open coding and thematic analysis of the qualitative data.  The systematic investigation of institutional and phenomenological data has the potential to: (1) generate practical knowledge about academic/career pathways in information technology for use by stakeholders; (2) identify and examine relationships among these pathways, students experiences, and psychosocial factors; and (3) add to the analytical methods available to institutional research professionals to document, investigate, and visualize student pathway information using data dashboards.  Four Florida community colleges that collectively serve rural and urban student populations (Pensacola State College, Florida State College at Jacksonville, Chipola College, and Gulf Coast State College) will pilot test the efficacy and usefulness of the method for modeling and visualizing their students’ college and career pathways.

By addressing the challenge of transferring information between qubits, which is one of the main obstacles in experimental quantum information processing, this research takes major steps toward making quantum computing a reality.  This project also involves education and outreach efforts. The principal investigator is developing interactive, week-long courses in experimental physics for local middle- and high-school students during the summer and also several workshops during the school year designed to ignite a passion for experimental research in the next generation of scientists.

This project plans to address this need by developing and testing a professional development model that fosters students’ employability skills.  The focus will be on students who are enrolled in a new Advanced Manufacturing Technology program/career pathway that will prepare them for careers as advanced manufacturing technicians. The research team will adapt the researcher-practitioner-partnership to support the development of these students’ employability skills. The project is estimated to directly serve at least fifty students pursuing associate degrees in the new program, six program faculty, and 25 additional faculty in both postsecondary and secondary technician programs.  The project's research activities will investigate: (1) the effectiveness of this approach to developing employability skills; (2) the feasibility of rapid development and testing of new curricula; and, (3) the effectiveness of short-term employability skills development experiences compared to multiple development experiences over time.<br/><br/>The researcher-practitioner-partnership method was developed to improve the flow and implementation of research findings into practice at the K-12 level.

2002741.xml,Collaborative Research: Atomically thin topological insulators via confinement heteroepitaxy,NSF,2020-07-01,2024-06-30,300000,"Nontechnical Description&lt;br/&gt;The dawn of quantum computing is rapidly developing with the potential to completely transform the field of computation. However, current quantum computers based on superconductors, ions, or atoms are prone to error due to imperfections. The solution to this grand challenge is to use new, engineered materials which are inherently immune to these imperfections. However, key questions remain regarding how to make a material that integrates the demanding properties needed to achieve superior performance in a technologically relevant manner. The principal investigators have created a new method to make ultra-thin metals, and this project focuses on understanding the microscopic properties of such metals, specifically bismuth and lead. The investigators will evaluate the impact of thinning these materials down to just a few atoms thick to explore how their properties change when they are manipulated at the atomic-scale. Beyond the scientific impact, this collaborative project will provide interdisciplinary research training for underrepresented graduate students, to broaden participation in science and engineering programs. The project will also develop a unique industry/university consortium to impart the importance of safety in industrial and research settings. This will not only better train future scientists for post-graduate careers in industry, but will also improve safety preparedness in academia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;The creation of a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) by reducing the dimensionality of a topological insulator from 3D to 2D could provide a unique, robust route to achieving topological superconductivity. This project will investigate the atomic-scale physical, chemical and electronic properties of 2D bismuth (Bi) and lead (Pb). Lead and bismuth exhibit very strong spin-orbit interactions, and exceptionally robust and easily accessible topological insulator properties that may enable the design of groundbreaking electronic devices with dissipationless spin currents, and the realization of Majorana bound states. Furthermore, these elements exhibit unconventional superconductivity, and could be combined with ferromagnetic materials, suggesting the possibility of creating a Pb-based topological superconductor. The investigators enable the study by synthesizing atomically thin, two-dimensional forms of these materials prepared via confinement heteroepitaxy (CHet) – a novel intercalation process that stabilizes 2D forms of 3D materials developed by the PIs. The SiC/graphene interface passivation is investigated before, during and after synthesis to understand how interface reconstruction can enable in-situ removal of the graphene cap for direct characterization access to the 2D-Bi and Pb.  Additionally, removing the graphene cap enables direct functionalization of the 2D metal to explore how modifying the surfaces of 2D-Bi and Pb changes their underlying physical properties, including bonding and electronic character. Finally, the project is developing a mechanistic understanding of how the structure and interfacial interactions with SiC and graphene impact electronic structure of 2D-Bi and 2D-Pb and elucidate how they differ from thin films deposited by traditional methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Optimal transport models have been successfully applied in fields as diverse as atmospheric sciences, surface matching, data clustering, and manifold learning, among others. The theoretical study of optimal transport has greatly advanced in recent years and calls for improved numerical tools that can be mathematically guaranteed to have good performance. This project is aimed at the development of improved numerical methods for optimal transport calculations and variants, employing partial-differential-equation techniques to produce computational tools backed by rigorous theory. The project provides research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. The PI will also engage in outreach by supervising an undergraduate team through the university's Summer Undergraduate Research Institute in Experimental Mathematics program, aimed at students who are at an earlier stage of study, with an eye toward recruitment of students from groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the project aims to exploit the geometric information that can be discerned from the regularity theory of the Monge-Ampère type equation that arises naturally in optimal transport, in order to develop numerical algorithms with proven convergence rates, error bounds, and computational complexity. The project will also undertake a systematic study of singular behavior when full regularity is unavailable to develop fast and accurate numerical schemes in such difficult cases. One intended application of this latter direction is toward a theory of manifold learning that can be applied to data sets coming from singular geometries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The L-function is an important object in the modern study of questions in number theory, in particular, solving Diophantine equations like the famous Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture and its generalizations. L-functions are also crucial in the study of representations of transformation groups, which have an important role in physics. The work is expected to provide important new understanding of these relations in higher dimensional cases. The investigator plans to organize workshops related to the project, which will provide students, postdocs, and other researchers in the area substantial opportunities for instruction, discussion, and collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scope of this project consists of four parts. In the first part, the investigator will use some new techniques in the study of trace formulas to solve questions concerning the relation between L-functions and automorphic periods -- those periods obtained by integrating automorphic forms along certain subgroups. The second part aims to extend some explicit formulas of automorphic periods, known as the Ichino-Ikeda formula, to more general cases by removing certain assumptions that are usually hard to check. The third part aims to provide unconditional evidence toward the Beilinson-Bloch conjecture on the relation between L-functions and Chow groups, which will generalize parallel results in the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture to higher dimensional cases. In the last part, the investigator plans to adopt a new approach via a relative trace formula to obtain variants of the arithmetic triple product formula concerning the height of certain cycles on a product of three modular elliptic curves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Even after enrolling to major in STEM degrees, African Americans are more likely to switch to non-STEM majors or leave college compared to other ethnic groups. The purpose of this project through the University of Connecticut is to examine the lived experiences of African American engineering undergraduates at three predominately white institutions (PWI). The investigators specifically focus on how students’ encounters with racism, stereotyping, discrimination, and gender biases may increase their isolation and contribute to their decisions to switch to non-engineering degrees during the first two years in their programs. They also investigate the strategies of African American students who persist in their engineering programs, such as joining engineering professional organizations such as the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) or establishing a supportive social network (includes peer and faculty mentors) that provide cultural familiarity to reduce their isolation and likelihood to switch to non-engineering majors. To make large-scale, long-term change in the culture of engineering programs, the investigators will use their research findings to develop evidence-based materials that target the ongoing problem of racial and gender-based microaggressions (i.e., intended or unintended insults and disparaging comments that demean African Americans and other marginalized populations). This project is supported by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development. While this project is primarily funded by the ECR program, additional support has been provided by the Directorate for Engineering's Broadening Participation in Engineering (BPE) program.<br/><br/>Theoretically-driven, this project’s research uses racism, intersectionality, and social capital theories to examine the racial and gender dynamics and practices that African American students experience, in addition to how their supportive social networks and other experiences influence their persistence in engineering. Uniquely, in this mixed-methods study, the investigators will use: 1) experience sampling method (ESM), which allows the collection of both real-time qualitative and quantitative data from participants about their experiences in their engineering programs as they occur and 2) oral stories that show how participants construct their realities within their engineering program cultures and harness their agency in the face of often disempowering circumstances. Students will also complete a baseline survey and a baseline interview about their academic, socioeconomic, and engineering backgrounds. Quantitative and qualitative data will be analyzed and these research findings will add to the growing literature on intersectionality and women of color in STEM higher education. This study adds a critical anthropological perspective to the ongoing theory-driven research and debate on race, intersectionality, and social capital within STEM education research. The findings will have broad impacts on the efforts of engineering and other STEM programs to diversify their student body.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Light is an especially promising tool for triggering this on-demand carrier disintegration: it can pass through many barriers, be directed to precise locations, and be switched on and off easily. Most current biologically relevant technologies use high energy ultraviolet (UV) and visible light that do not penetrate tissue significantly. The research groups of Professor Samuel Thomas at Tufts University and Professor Vincent Rotello at the University of Massachusetts Amherst are working to overcome this limitation in therapeutic delivery by designing, developing, and understanding the ability of nano-sized materials to disintegrate upon exposure to low energy near-infrared (NIR) light. NIR light penetrates tissue to far greater depths than UV or visible light, providing access to new biological applications. They will gain understanding into how chemical design influences nanomaterial response to NIR light, and these materials will be further elaborated to target and deliver therapeutics to both cancer cells and bacterial biofilms. This research has the potential to benefit society through creation of new nanomaterials that harness NIR light to selectively deliver drugs and mitigate harmful side effects. Beyond the hands-on interdisciplinary training that this research provides to more graduate students, this project also provides targeted support for disadvantaged high school students to undertake research through the Tufts Summer Research Experience, thereby broadening participation in the STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>With support from the Biomaterials Program of the NSF Division of Materials Research, the goal of this research is to establish the ability of micelles in vitro to be degraded by singlet oxygen prepared in situ using NIR light. The overall project goal is to understand how chemical structures and polymer assemblies influence key individual chemical and physical material characteristics relevant to drug delivery. The first phase of this project will be to prepare and characterize polymers and micelles with a range of singlet oxygen-cleavable linkers, reactivities, and polymer topologies. The second phase of this project will be to understand how chemical structure and nanomaterial composition determines loading of cargo, stability in serum, photodegradation, and triggered release. The third stage of this project will evaluate the in vitro cytotoxicity and anti-bacterial activity of cargo-loaded NIR-degradable micelles. Further extension of this understanding of fundamental structure-property relationships will include micelles with targeting groups on their surfaces such as the RGD motif for cancer cells and quaternary ammonium cations for bacterial biofilms. Overall, this work has the potential to improve the efficacy of light-responsive drug-delivery systems, and in a broader context, advance the field of stimuli-responsive biomaterials by correlating chemical structures and their assemblies with loading, release, and in vitro activity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nondestructive testing is used to test the safety of structures, vehicles, or vessels using technologies such as ultrasound and X-ray analysis.  Nondestructive testing technicians help U.S. vessel, vehicle, pipeline, and infrastructure industries meet quality and safety assurance requirements, thus preventing injury or loss of life. The shortage of workers in nondestructive testing results from both high industry demand and a shortage of training programs. Consequently, the project proposes to develop a new Associate of Applied Science degree program and two specialized certificate programs in nondestructive testing. This curriculum has the potential to increase the capacity of educational institutions to provide classroom training leading to American Society for Nondestructive Testing Level II certification. Activities will also be developed that promote diversity in high technology careers by focusing recruitment efforts on high school students and incumbent workers from groups that are not yet well represented in this employment sector. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Innovative aspects of the curriculum will include: (1) a focus on weld testing, with an integration of nondestructive testing and welding curricular content in the AAS degree program; and (2) alignment with American Society for Nondestructive Testing certification standards to ensure the highest quality of preparation for graduates. The project’s objectives are to: (1) develop curricula for radiographic testing and ultrasonic testing certificates that lead to fulfillment of American Society for Nondestructive Testing Level II classroom requirements; (2) to align the two certificates and the associate’s degree program to create flexible academic pathways for students; (3) to enhance student learning with new equipment for teaching radiographic testing and phased array ultrasonic testing; and (4) to recruit and enroll high school students and incumbent workers in the new pathways to earning nondestructive testing credentials. A research study will add new knowledge regarding the effectiveness of the recruitment activities, including activities introduced in a summer camp and in a dual enrollment welding curriculum. The project evaluation will examine the effectiveness and impact of industry relationships, curriculum development, use of new equipment, and recruitment activities, with regard to the intended learning outcomes and alignment with the needs of students and employers. This project can provide a model for career and educational pathways in nondestructive testing that other colleges may replicate or adapt.

Biologists have long believed that interactions with predators, competitors, and helpful mutualists are a powerful force in the history of life, helping to spur the formation of new species. However, it is difficult to test whether interactions between living things have been more important than the effects of the physical environment like heat, freezing, or drought. This project makes that comparison by taking advantage of a unique interaction between species that live in the extreme environments of the Mojave Desert. Joshua trees, the spikey, twisted-looking trees found across the Mojave, cannot produce fruit without the help of yucca moths. Joshua tree flowers appear to be adapted to the moths, but the trees also experience extreme heat and drought, and it seems likely that these effects of the physical, nonliving environment also impact their survival. The Joshua Tree Genome Project will use genetic sequencing and experiments with Joshua tree seedlings to study how the trees cope with different climates in different parts of the desert. The project collaborators can then compare the effects of climate on Joshua tree populations to the effects of their interaction with yucca moths. The team will also engage volunteers and science teachers across the Mojave region to measure and monitor Joshua tree populations in their own backyards. By examining the Joshua tree's adaptation to climate in detail for the first time, this project will help to answer a longstanding question in the history of life on Earth — whether interactions between living things or the physical environment have been more important — and develop scientific tools and community partnerships that can help protect Joshua trees under changing future climates.<br/><br/>The Joshua Tree Genome Project is a collaboration of ecologists, geneticists, bioinformaticians, and plant physiologists at Willamette University, California State University Northridge, the Universities of Alabama and Hawaii, and the US Geological Survey Western Ecological Research Center. The collaborators will plant Joshua tree seedlings at common-garden sites around the Mojave, monitor their growth and physiological performance, and use RNA sequencing to identify genes that are differentially expressed in different climates. The team will complete a Joshua tree reference genome and use it with the gene expression results to design a sequence capture array for targeted sequencing of hundreds of trees. Targeted sequencing will allow them to perform genome-wide association study (GWAS) of physiological traits that contribute to seedlings’ survival and performance in the common gardens, and of floral traits related to pollination by yucca moths. The team will then use landscape genomic analyses to identify genes showing signatures of local adaptation to variation in climate and moth traits. Meanwhile, the team will expand a participatory science program working with Mojave-regional conservation nonprofits and K-12 educators to train volunteers to survey the demography of Joshua tree populations, recording how many trees flower and produce fruit, and how many young trees are present to renew the population. Finally, the team will use the results of their genetic analyses to build a genomic prediction protocol that can project the physiological and pollination-related traits of a Joshua tree population from genetic data alone. The team will use this protocol to predict the traits of trees at sites profiled by volunteer surveys, and test for relationships between populations’ predicted trait values and their demographic health. This will allow them to identify specific traits that influence the fitness of Joshua trees in current conditions, and would provide a tool to assess the resilience of Joshua tree populations in future climates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

DNA is the blueprint that directs the molecular basis of life on our planet. However, despite decades of research, there remains an incomplete understanding of how enzymes make new copies of DNA inside cells.  The collection of images is assembled to produce the equivalent of an animated movie showing the precise order of each step in the reaction pathway at the atomic level. The detailed insights into the chemical mechanism of these enzymes leads potentially to the design of new polymerases for applications in biotechnology. In addition, this project includes a significant educational component that is designed to attract and maintain student interest in the chemical and biological sciences. This includes pro-active engagement in a number of university-sponsored programs, including the Minority Science Program, aimed at improving the participation of traditionally underrepresented groups in science.  <br/><br/>Time-resolved X-ray crystallography is a powerful method for studying the mechanism of enzymes by capturing intermediates that cannot be observed in the lowest energy states of static protein crystal structures. This project investigates the mechanism of DNA synthesis by collecting time-lapsed images of the Bacillus stearothermophilus (Bst) and the Klenow-fragment analogue of the Thermus aquaticus (KlenTaq) DNA polymerase. The objectives are to provide details of a tyrosine gating mechanism that prevents frame-shift mutations and a novel push-pull mechanism during elongation. In addition, the study probes an unusual alternative reaction catalyzed by Bst polymerase that uses non-canonical templates (RNA, 2-fluoro-arabino nucleic acid, or alpha-L-threose nucleic acid) for DNA elongation. The time-lapse structures are projected to identify conformational changes as they occur in the enzyme active site.

2001973.xml,"Conference Proposal: Support Student and Early Professional Attendance to the 2020 North American Ornithological Conference, San Juan, Puerto Rico",NSF,2020-01-01,2020-12-31,50000,"The study of birds (Ornithology) tends to be divided among many scientific societies that each focus on birds of one or two countries. This is a problem because birds are found almost everywhere and move great distances in migration. They ignore national borders. Scientists from different countries who study birds (ornithologists) would thus benefit from working more together. This is hard to achieve because travel to distant meetings to form new partnerships can be financially prohibitive, especially for young ornithologists, who are the future of the field.  This project will support travel by students and early career professionals to the 7th North American Ornithological Conference (NAOC) in San Juan, Puerto Rico, 10-15 August, 2020. The conference theme, ""Flight Paths Addressing Global Challenges"", and its Caribbean location will bring together ornithologists from across North, Central and South America. They will meet to talk about many topics, including migration, conservation, ecology and evolution. Scientific highlights will include a keynote address by a famous ornithologist, plenary talks, and four days of presentations on a wide variety of topics. The conference will attract many participants from Puerto Rico, who are often unable to afford meetings in the continental United States. There will be five mentoring activities, about 20 workshops targeted at young participants, and involvement of the public in multiple activities.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will help fund travel of more than 60 participants. Funds from NSF will augment funds already provided by the convening societies, to leverage an extraordinary level of participation by ornithologists from Latin America and the Caribbean. Many of them will be joining participants from North American ornithological societies for the first time. More than 1,300 attendees are expected, representing academia, non-profit organizations, and diverse government agencies, and including eight ornithological societies from North America, Mexico, the Caribbean, and the New World Tropics.  Several initiatives in this conference build on lessons from previous ornithological conferences to instill trust and develop infrastructure necessary to coordinate understanding and protection of birds, and the environments on which they depend, throughout the Western Hemisphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To do so, this research study will conduct a meta-analysis of mathematics teaching strategies used in informal learning environments, such as museums, libraries, and the home. A meta-analysis examines published research data, paying close attention to differences in findings, and uses statistics to analyze the findings across different studies.  This meta-analysis will summarize the relevant research about mathematics teaching that has been published since 1980, focusing on children in preschool to the end of third grade. It will also focus on mathematics learning topics of numbers and operations, algebra, geometry, measurement, and data analysis. The researchers will include data from peer-reviewed research, conference proposals, reports, and dissertations. In choosing which research studies should be included in their analysis, the researchers will consider the specific teaching strategies used, the participants in the study, and the training that the adults received. The project intends use their analysis to show what effective mathematics teaching looks like in informal learning environments.  This information can provide insights about best mathematics teaching practices for young children in informal learning environments. In this way, it can benefit mathematics education by informing the decision-making of researchers, practitioners, parents, childcare providers, teacher educators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a thorough review of the literature and collection of relevant studies, the researchers will code each contributing study for methodological, participant, and intervention characteristics, study quality, and type of dependent measure. The researchers will also double code studies to establish inter-rater agreement to ensure consistency in coding procedures across reviewers. A random-effects meta-regression will then be used to synthesize standardized mean difference effect sizes to determine an overall average effect and evaluate coded moderators that may account for variability in the observed effects. Cluster robust variance estimation will be used to account for dependence between effect sizes collected from the same study. This project has the potential to make a unique contribution to the field by (a) responding to a recent upward trend of empirical research on mathematics interventions in informal learning environments; (b) reporting on the current quality of evidence of intervention studies as a means to improve future research studies in this area; (c) broadening stakeholders’ knowledge base regarding training parents and childcare providers to implement effective mathematics interventions; and (d) implementing a rigorous research plan and meta-analytic techniques.

The forum will bring together specialists in structural geology and tectonics for oral and poster presentations, field trips, and short courses. The Structural Geology and Tectonics Program provides the framework for the structural geology and tectonics community to communicate, develop, and advance teaching and research among educators and investigators. These forums play a key role in identifying key pedagogical advances and methods applied to structural geology and tectonics, important science questions in structural geology and tectonics, while initiating collaborative relationships to address these questions. The meeting will include three days of presentations that will include technical sessions that involve themes that have been identified by a recently published community vision document that highlighted important research areas in tectonics. The workshop will also identify and discuss pedagogical advances and advances and methods, specifically as they apply to some of the discipline specific challenges of teaching structural geology and tectonics and discuss future directions in tectonics research.  It will create opportunities to foster new collaborations through the cross-pollination of ideas and techniques, and it will provide a platform for early career professionals and students that supports and promotes their careers at a critical stage in their professional development. Following the format of previous meetings, each session will highlight an important area of current research and/or education that will be anchored by a distinguished keynote speaker and will showcase relevance of work on the topic. Poster sessions with abundant time for full participant interaction will accompany each session. The forum will be organized to maximize the exchange of ideas between participants in open discussions. Sessions will provide ample opportunity to ask questions of individual presenters, assess the current state of our knowledge, and consider productive areas for future research. In addition to the formal meeting, there will be field trips to examine the geology of selected areas of adjacent areas that will focus on best practices for teaching in the field and leading more accessible field trips. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Structural Geology and Tectonics Forum is designed to facilitate community building and personal interaction within different segments of the structural geology community. It will bring together faculty from research universities, liberal arts colleges, community and two-year colleges, and minority-serving institutions. Speakers who identify as members of traditionally underrepresented groups as well as professionals from two- and four- year colleges will provide diverse representation across all of the organizing committees for the 2020 forum. Importantly, there will be group discussions on critical developments in structural geology and tectonics, and what future research priorities should be. This community building effort will help create a stronger, more vibrant group of scientists and help introduce graduate students and advanced undergraduates to the structural geology and tectonics disciplines. The setting will be particularly useful for graduate students, who will be able to use the venue and informal nature of the forum to find out what research is taking place at other institutions, meet a wide range of faculty, and develop useful contacts which will be of great value to their future careers. Informal mentoring sessions will facilitate opportunities for early career professionals and students in navigating careers in structural geology and tectonics. Students will present their own work in a friendly environment where they can obtain thoughtful and useful feedback, as well as providing opportunity to build new scientific collaborations. An important contribution of this forum will include a session aimed identifying one session will be aimed at best practices to promote equity, diversity and inclusion in the classroom. By focusing on classroom activities and approaches, successful strategies can be identified that can be adopted by other institutions to minimize the “leaky pipeline” that is known to be part of the problem with retention of underrepresented groups in the geosciences. Abstracts, field guides, and short course notes will be disseminated through a dedicated website that will be publicly accessible. Continued support for the Structural Geology and Tectonics Forum contributes to the long-term health, vitality, and infrastructure of the Earth Science community. The Structural Geology and Tectonics Forum benefits society and advances desired societal outcomes by its emphasis on STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) education and educator development at a variety of levels, by contributing to the training of the next generation of scientists, by contributing to the broadening of underrepresented groups in STEM, and by contributing to the advancement of scientific literacy of the public.

2002865.xml,A telescopic algorithm for two-dimensional hidden Markov models with application to genetic studies,NSF,2019-09-01,2024-08-31,1172296,"Family-based genetic studies use a number of statistical techniques to understand how genetic information flows from parent to offspring. The investigators will develop computationally efficient algorithms for identifying genetic information from family data using a technique known as a Hidden Markov model. This model has demonstrated considerable success in a broad range of scientific disciplines, including areas such as speech recognition in telephone conversations and face identification from sequences of images. When the complexity of the problem increases, computational algorithms confront challenges with finding the solution of the model in realistic and practical time frames. The investigators' research on novel computational and statistical approaches will provide efficient algorithms, and software tools, of broad scientific relevance. In their work the tools developed will yield a more powerful approach for finding genes underlying complex diseases. The collaborative team will also directly apply their techniques to forestry genetic data describing a multi-year plant-breeding program.  Educationally, the trainees involved will be integrated into a vibrant interdisciplinary research team, gaining exposure to techniques for the solution of real world problems. <br/><br/>Multi-dimensional Markov processes are ubiquitous in the real world. Dependencies in interacting particle systems, images, videos, digitized documents, and gene transmission are all examples of multi-dimensional Markov processes. A Markov process is a random process (i.e., a statistical phenomenon in which the possible outcomes of a sequence of events or variables vary) in which the prediction of the future state is made just using the information of the current state, independent of both past history and unknown future states. This idea generalizes for higher dimensions.  For example, gene transmission from parent to child is a two-dimensional Markov process, the determination of the future state, the child, depends on the neighbors in two dimensions, the parents.  Most cases of interest, however, are hidden Markov processes, in which the current state of a variable cannot be observed, but must be inferred by consideration of all possible future states given all possible current states.  As the number of quantities to be determined increases, the computational demand in both computer memory and computing time increases dramatically. To apply the concept, therefore, to many important real applications requires the development of novel and powerful computational algorithms.  This project is focused on the design of a novel software package, specifically designed for the solution of hidden Markov models. The techniques developed will be relevant for the solution of problems from a broad array of disciplines, not only for wider family based genetic studies but also areas such as text analysis from images. Thus, this project will increase the computational ability to solve real-world problems across many engineering, geosciences and biological disciplines, with commensurate potential positive societal impact. In this case an interesting application arises in plant breeding through the collaboration with experts in forestry science."

Researchers at the University of Virginia and the Tennessee Board of Regents will investigate three research questions: (1) Do customized utility-value interventions lead to improved academic outcomes compared to standard utility-value interventions or a control condition? (2) Do utility-value interventions benefit the same students in community college settings, and through the same underlying mechanisms, as in four-year institutions? (3) Are the effects of utility-value interventions sustained in future STEM courses? The project involves 16,000 students at 13 Tennessee community colleges.  The researchers use a double-blind design with students randomly assigned to a customized utility-value, standard utility-value or control condition.  Measures include: students’ reactions to the intervention materials, psychological processes (i.e., participant success expectancies, intrinsic value, attainment value, utility value, and perceived cost), moderator variables (i.e., student academic preparedness, demographics, cultural mismatch, identity threat and perceived instructor value-supportive practice; and instructor characteristics), and outcomes (i.e., course completion or withdrawal, course grades, STEM grade point average and number of STEM courses).  This project is supported by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development. The ECR program supports the accumulation of robust evidence to inform efforts to understand, build theory to explain, and suggest intervention and innovations to address persistent challenges in STEM interest, education, learning and participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advancing a diverse and technically competent STEM workforce is critical for contributing to the progress of science and to the health, prosperity and welfare of our nation.  The students who participant in this research project are likely to benefit from the interventions under investigation.  By studying utility-value intervention in math gateway courses there is potential to inform post-secondary administrators, faculty and instructors about more effective instructional practices for student success in STEM education.  Additionally, advancing knowledge about some of the very specific underlying mechanisms that benefit student STEM learning and persistence in community college settings, and whether these mechanisms are similar to those already known about students in four-year college STEM settings, could benefit implementation research about those uniquely different post-secondary settings and may significantly contribute to improved instruction to benefit all undergraduate students who are learning STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Atmospheric OA affect the Earth’s climate in crucial but poorly understood ways. The uncertainty is largely due to the complex chemical processes that constantly change OA compositions during their lifetime of weeks. Professor Zhang and his group study the chemical reactions of organic peroxy radicals (RO2) at the surfaces of the particles. These chemical processes largely determine the chemical composition and physiochemical properties of the particle interface. Better knowledge of the details of these reactions improves our understanding of the evolution and impacts of OA. Other broader impacts of this project include the training and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students, especially those from the underrepresented groups. In addition, Professor Zhang leads outreach activities with Riverside high schools that serve minority students and participates in a summer academy program aimed at enhancing STEM education for diverse students.<br/><br/>The project focuses on the heterogeneous hydroxyl radical oxidation of OA proxies and the subsequent pathways of RO2 at the OA particle interface. This includes the previously under-explored RO2 + hydroperoxyl radical, RO2 + nitric oxide, RO2 dimerization, and RO2 autoxidation reactions. Laboratory oxidation experiments are performed using a hybrid continuous-flow reaction system. This provides information on the relative importance of the various RO2 reaction pathways. The different pathways are impacted by the OA composition, liquid water content, oxidation timescales, and oxidant concentrations. The team uses a suite of advanced mass spectrometry instrumentation to systematically study the oxidation kinetics and the chemical composition of key oxidation products. A multiphase reaction-diffusion kinetic model framework representing the interfacial RO2 processes of interest is being developed. The model is based on experimental results and presents a crucial extension to the current understanding of radical-initiated OA heterogeneous oxidation mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result of the wide incorporation of CRISPER-based technologies in genetic engineering, there is a need for a biotechnology workforce that is trained in its use. Community colleges are adept at meeting rapidly changing workforce needs such as this.  To this end, Delaware Technical Community College proposes to develop and incorporate CRISPR-based gene editing training into its biotechnology curriculum. This work will be done in collaboration with the Gene Editing Institute at ChristianaCare, a Delaware-based healthcare organization. The project also aims to provide workshops to train community college faculty across the nation in CRISPR-based gene editing techniques. The trained faculty can in turn educate large numbers of students about this gene editing technique, to better prepare students for the current biotechnology workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This partnership combines the content expertise of staff at the Gene Editing Institute with that of faculty at Delaware Technical Community College to develop and implement a high impact CRISPR-based gene editing curriculum and to offer training workshops for faculty. The project includes engagement with industry partners and national experts in bioethics. The professional development workshops will enable participants to broaden biotechnology instruction related to CRISPR use, as well related ethical issues.  Through these activities, the project expects to serve nearly 100 bioscience students at Delaware Technical Community College and 90 community college faculty. The intention is to help students gain the knowledge and skills needed to contribute to a rapidly expanding field with a wide range of applications. The specific aims of the project are to: (1) continue to update and provide effective training in state-of-the-art gene editing techniques to prepare students in a two-year biotechnology program to enter bioscience careers or further education; (2) disseminate an advanced, current curriculum and model high impact teaching practices to community college instructors through three and five day gene editing workshops. The employability skills of graduates will be strengthened and broadened with the use of classroom activities that involve analysis and interpretation of bioinformatic data, technical oral presentations, understanding and evaluation of scientific literature, and group work as examples. As a result of these efforts, the project team expects to contribute to the national need for technicians who are skilled in gene editing technologies.

Dietary fat can impact both the composition of the gut microbiome and the generation of metabolites by the gut microbiome. Using chickens (Gallus gallus) as a vertebrate model, this study will investigate the interactive effects of dietary fat type and quantity on the composition of metabolites produced by gut microbiota, and will identify consequent changes in brain function (neurotransmitter signaling) and bird behavior. This study will utilize cutting-edge analytical techniques including genomics, metagenomics, gene expression, and electrophysiology to examine these interactive effects, with this work being conducted by both faculty and student researchers at three collaborating institutions. This study will provide mentored research experiences to more than a dozen biological and animal science students from the historically black institutions (HBCUs) involved in this project, as well as training three PhD students. Results from this study are expected to lead to a more complete understanding of how dietary fat types and the microbiota impact animal health, with potential applications to human health and the agricultural production of chickens. By involving undergraduate students from two HBCUs in the research, the project will help motivate impactful scientific researchers of the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that dietary fat type and concentration impact the physiological and behavioral conditions of animals with respect to nutrient levels, brain function, and reactivity to stress. However, the molecular mechanisms by which dietary fat and gut microbiota interact to influence the central serotonergic system are yet to be elucidated in birds. In this study, male and female chickens of varying ages will serve as model vertebrate animals to understand how changes in dietary fat type and concentration impact the activity of the central serotonergic system. Changes in gut microbiota in response to diet and age will be evaluated through 16S rRNA sequencing and shotgun metagenomics. Resulting shifts in metabolites produced from intestinal microbial fermentation processes will be determined by metabolomics, and relevant metabolites will be tracked from the gut through the blood, and to the brain. A systems-based analysis will enable the identification of metabolites that cross the blood-brain barrier to potentially modulate brain signaling and serotonin synthesis. Changes in bird behavior will be studied by using video recordings and software to perform neurobehavioral analysis. Expression levels of genes involved in production of behavior-modulating neurotransmitters will be quantified as correlates of dietary fat and gut microbiota interactions. The results may lead to improvements in the agricultural production of chickens. This multifaceted project will provide integrative STEM training experiences for undergraduate students and three PhD-level trainees.

NMR is a powerful tool for chemists; it is useful for determining molecular structure and for monitoring the progress of chemical reactions. NMR's clinical cousin, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important tool for producing images of soft tissues in the body. However, both methods usually suffer from low sensitivity - meaning that they cannot detect small amounts of sample or low concentrations. ""Hyperpolarization"" methods can increase NMR signals by a factor of 1000 or more, but are usually technically challenging and extremely expensive. The Warren group is exploring the fundamental chemistry and physics behind new strategies with prospects of providing routine hyperpolarization as a simple and cost-effective add-on to any NMR spectrometer.  The team is also providing research and training opportunities in these critical technologies for members of underrepresented groups, and providing substantial K-12 science outreach.<br/><br/>The Warren group studies the production, quantum statistical mechanics, and characterization of hyperpolarized, long-lived nuclear spin states in NMR and MRI.  They seek to drastically improve the generality, fractional polarization, and absolute polarization levels of nuclei such as 15N, 13C and 19F from parahydrogen gas (p-H2) in solution, without chemical reaction, thereby enabling applications ranging from quantifying rotational-state effects on reactivity in solution to dark matter detection.  The ability to make and store large quantities of p-H2 should enable creation of massively large (kg size) continuously hyperpolarized targets which can serve as ultrasensitive magnetometers (e.g. for dark matter detection) or can drastically reduce the size of the magnets needed for clinical MRI. Applicability can also be expanded by the ability to make p-H2 at the L-atm/hour level using a simple, inexpensive laboratory apparatus. While ultra-low-field NMR is not new, this work aims to bring it into the mainstream, while also enabling better high-field experiments.  The aim is to reduce or eliminate the cost and complexity barriers to implementation of hyperpolarization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Materials can be insulators, with very low electrical conductivity, or metals, with high electrical conductivity, depending on how the negatively charged electrons move amongst the stationary and positively charged atomic nuclei. Some materials are semimetals where the properties lie between those of metals and insulators.  Recently there has been a great deal of interest in topological semimetals where topology plays a major role in determining their properties.  This project will investigate the electrical conduction of topological semimetals under high magnetic field to pinpoint their unique characteristics. The results will enable laboratory tests to separate topological semimetals from more conventional counterparts, and to determine the robustness of topological characteristics under conditions that would be encountered in technological applications. These outcomes can be directly employed in developing fabrication techniques and device design strategies to incorporate the novel properties and functionality of topological semimetals in innovative technologies.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>This project aims to identify the magnetotransport and diamagnetic signatures that distinguish topological semimetals from conventional semimetals with large non-saturating magnetoresistance (MR). The outcomes will clarify the universal features of topological semimetal that are unique characteristics of topological electronic structures and the associated Berry phase.  A framework will be developed to characterize the disorder leading to the emergence of linear MR in the high field limit, which is expected to render a better understanding of the roles of disorder in linear MR phenomena in general. The prediction for the emergence of linear MR as a consequence of topological nodes and linear dispersion in band structure will be tested for a broader range of semimetal systems and will uncover the common elements of the linear non-saturating MR phenomena.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Crossover youth are disproportionately likely to experience social and economic disadvantage, and the dual system involvement may fundamentally shape their adolescence and transition to adulthood. This project investigates how juvenile court institutions characterize and respond to crossover youth, how crossover youth experience their dual status as “dependent” and “delinquent,” and how crossover youths’ experiences in court influence their well-being as they proceed through adolescence. In addition to investigating the relationship between state institutions and inequality in the United States, the project will show how the state distinguishes between victims and offenders and how it interacts with the families so affected. Findings will inform state policies affecting the operation of both child welfare and juvenile justice systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will combine longitudinal interviews and ethnographic observation to examine how juvenile court institutions respond to crossover youth and how crossover youth experience the court process themselves. Data will be drawn from repeated interviews with 35 to 40 crossover youth over the course of a year, as well as ethnographic observation in juvenile court and interviews with key decision makers in both dependency and delinquency courts. Longitudinal follow-ups with crossover youth will grant insight into how young people experience the court process, and court observation will provide a unique opportunity to observe interactions between court actors and youth and compare what happens in court to how individuals describe their court experiences in interviews. Findings will inform sociological theories regarding juvenile justice and the law, as well as the sociology of childhood and transition to adulthood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Graduate and undergraduate students engaged in this research receive broad interdisciplinary training, and contribute to the development of relevant introductory chemistry materials that will be made freely available to the public.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Self-diffusion in a dense gas of neutral molecules is non-Markovian and must be modeled by a Langevin equation with memory kernel. The Bouchard group has obtained experimental NMR spectroscopy results that are consistent with a generalized Langevin description, as confirmed by an unexpected temperature dependence of the NMR linewidth as well as dependence on inter-pulse spacing during Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) experiments. While the new theory describes the results of free self-diffusion well, the diffusion behavior in the presence of boundaries has not yet been explored.  Dr. Bouchard is now probing restricted diffusion in porous media possessing various types of boundaries, and developing new extensions of the underlying theory based on the stochastic calculus of bounded diffusions (sticky, reflecting, killing, and absorbing boundaries). The new NMR-based methods may shed new light into the kinetic theory of gases, benefitting chemical physics and medical imaging by offering new tools to extract information about pore structure and function in media such as porous rocks, soils, or lungs. The tools also show promise for both characterization of catalytically reactive surfaces and mass transport during reactions and provision of a better understanding of hyperpolarized gas MRI.  Educational impacts will derive from the training and active participation of multiple students in the research as well as the creation of free online educational course materials disseminated via the institution's web site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002541.xml,P2C2: Collaborative Research: Transient forcing of the Local Last Glacial Maximum in the tropical Peruvian Andes,NSF,2020-06-15,2025-05-31,229506,"The geological history of tropical glaciers can provide scientists an important perspective from the past on how Earth’s climate system responds to human activity. This project will look to the geological record of tropical glaciers in the Andes Mountains for a perspective on past changes in the glacial ice extent and how these changes may relate to records of changes in the atmospheric conditions during periods of abrupt climate change. These records of glacial activity will help place the current state of rapidly retreating ice margins in the tropics in a longer-term context that extends well beyond the instrumental record. Finally, by integrating multiple archives of past climates and modeling the causes of tropical high elevation climate changes, this work will improve our understanding of abrupt global climate changes because these regions had much larger glaciers in the past. By determining ages on the rocks that were transported by the ancient glaciers and combining analyses of lake sediments deposited continuously below the glaciers, this research will provide a detailed record of how much the glaciers changed and when. The research team will incorporate climate model simulations to test the causes of tropical climate changes and how they relate to high latitude warming and cooling events. This project will train 3 graduate students, and at least 4 undergraduate students. The project team will improve K-12 science education and engagement by exposing teachers and students (both local and abroad) to research through the GLOBE program (Global Learning and Observation to Benefit the Environment). The team also will partner with INAIGEM in Peru to broaden project impact, and help with the mission of educational capacity building.<br/> <br/>This project will evaluate tropical glacial variability during the local Last Glacial Maximum (LLGM) to better understand how low latitude temperature variability and the hydrologic cycle were modulated by ocean and atmospheric processes. This research has the following objectives: 1) determine robust ages of moraines using terrestrial cosmogenic radionuclide (TCN) dating methods to provide information about both the timing and extent of multiple LLGM ice limits; 2) rigorously evaluate centennial-scale records of glacial flour flux using high-resolution geochemical archives from the recently acquired Lake Junín drill-core record; 3) test the scale and climatic forcing of LLGM climate variability using climate model simulations; 4) test the scale of LLGM glacier variability responses to climatic forcing using energy and mass-balance models. This research will produce multi-proxy, centennial-scale records of mountain glaciation in Peru spanning the LLGM, at a scale and resolution that has not yet been achieved. This resolution will be sufficient to make comparisons with ice cores from Greenland, Antarctica, and the tropical Andes, as well as decadal-scale speleothem-based stable isotope records of hydroclimate changes from the same (Lake Junín) catchment. This will allow for a collective evaluation of mountain glacier archives and other regional records of past atmospheric variability that will improve our understanding of the role of the tropics in abrupt global change events on millennial timescales. These records will provide insight on the sensitivity of tropical glaciers to a range of climate conditions, both atmospheric and oceanic, and particularly how the tropical climate system responds to meltwater forcing. Ultimately, these records will inform how the tropical hydrologic cycle drives glacial-interglacial cycles in both the low and high latitudes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Improved projections of future climate rely on more detailed understanding of the mechanisms driving Earth’s climate system, which can often be illuminated from the perspective of geological records of past climates. The research funded by this award will examine the largest global warming event in the recent geological past: the transition from the last ice age to the present interglacial world. First, a climate record will be produced by documenting the age and location of landforms left by rapidly retreating glaciers at the end of the last ice age. These records will then be used, along with computer models, to test hypotheses about different components of the climate system that are thought to play important roles in rapid warming of Earth. Such information will improve understanding of how Earth’s climate system operates and inform models used for climate prediction. This detailed understanding of Earth's climate system may help policy makers to articulate climate policies that will provide multiple societal benefits. The researchers will also educate young scientists in STEM fields, thereby increasing the STEM workforce, which is in the national interest. This award will also will support the education of a science journalism student, who will be trained to communicate the science results to the public, providing long-term benefits of public awareness and understanding of global change science.<br/><br/>Despite significant progress, the origin of ice-age terminations remains unresolved. At the core of this issue is the precise inter- and intra-hemispheric timing of the end of the ice age, because such information yields clues as to the mechanisms that underlie the termination. The research team will test the hypothesis that the temperature rise of the last termination in southern latitudes was earlier and faster than previously recognized, so fast that it may require a major overhaul of existing hypotheses. The research project will use detailed radiocarbon and exposure dating of glacial landforms, along with glaciological modeling, to document the timing and magnitude of the termination of the Cordillera Darwin icefield, in southernmost South America. These data will be integrated with existing paleoclimate records at lower latitudes with the GFDL Earth System Model 2M to assess the feasibility of various forcing factors for the termination, such as an ocean bipolar seesaw, shifting of the southern hemisphere westerlies, and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. This work will strengthen collaborations between US and Chilean institutions and afford mentoring and education opportunities for students.

2001903.xml,Collaborative Research: Cirrus Cloud Formation and Microphysical Properties from In-situ Observed Characteristics to Global Climate Impacts,NSF,2019-09-01,2022-07-31,360733,"This study will investigate the determinant factors behind cirrus cloud formation and evolution based on in-situ observations at various geographical locations. In addition, the global radiative forcing of observation-constrained aerosol impacts on cirrus microphysical properties will be quantified by using a climate model. The project will focus on three critical scientific issues: (1) Hemispheric differences in cirrus cloud macroscopic and microphysical properties under similar dynamical conditions; (2) Multi-scale dynamical forcings driving ice nucleation and their impacts on cirrus simulations in a climate model; and (3) Impacts of anthropogenic aerosol emissions on cirrus microphysical properties and the subsequent influences on global radiation.<br/><br/>To address these scientific issues, The research team will: (1) extract cirrus cloud samples from a composite in-situ dataset covering various geographical locations, and compare the formation and evolution of cirrus clouds between two hemispheres; (2) examine the micro- to mesoscale (~0.1-10 km) variabilities of water vapor and temperature, and improve the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) by including these observed variabilities; (3) compare the in-situ measured cirrus microphysical properties between polluted and pristine regions, and use CAM5 to quantify the consequent perturbations on global radiation balance.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>Cirrus clouds are one of the main modulators of Earth's climate system. However, due to their large spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability, cirrus clouds remain one of the poorly-represented components in current general circulation models (GCMs). This project will improve our understanding of cirrus microphysical properties in relation to dynamical conditions and aerosol backgrounds, by analyzing in-situ aircraft data obtained from both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, polluted and pristine regions. Furthermore, the research team will use the observed characteristics to evaluate the simulations of relative humidity and cirrus clouds in CAM5 in terms of their occurrence, spatial coverage and microphysical properties. In addition, a ""best-observation-matched"" ice microphysics configuration will be implemented into CAM5.  Overall, using micro- to mesoscale observations of cirrus formation and evolution, the research will improve cirrus cloud simulations in CAM5 and provide a new estimation on cirrus clouds' adjustments due to anthropogenic aerosol emissions (i.e., aerosol indirect forcing through perturbations of cirrus microphysical properties).<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>Both the observational dataset and the new model parameterization will be released to the community, including a synthesized in-situ observation dataset (a total of 8 campaigns from NSF, NASA and European Union), and a sub-grid scale parameterization of relative humidity variability for GCMs. The improved estimation of anthropogenic aerosol impact on cirrus cloud radiative forcing can contribute to uncertainty reduction in the next IPCC report. The project will greatly benefit teaching and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students at University of Wyoming and San Jose State University. The project will also recruit and train undergraduate students for presenting their research at the local K-12 schools via San Jose State University's undergraduate Ambassador Program."
2002354.xml,RUI: The molecular basis of a genetically accommodated larval color polyphenism,NSF,2020-12-01,2024-11-30,261542,"Phenotypic plasticity refers to the ability of an organism to generate distinct morphological, behavioral or metabolic changes in response to environmental changes. Laboratory and theoretical research has shown that phenotypic plasticity may play an important role in shaping the evolutionary trajectory of species, although the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. This project will lead to a better understanding of the molecular and physiological basis of phenotypic plasticity by comparing two strains of caterpillars that differ in their response to temperature: one strain remains black at all temperatures and another turns green at higher temperatures. Black caterpillars have lower levels of juvenile hormone than green caterpillars, and the project will elucidate the regulation of this important hormone that controls insect growth and development. Determining the molecular and physiological basis of phenotypic plasticity has important implications for our understanding of environmentally-induced diseases, generation of novel traits, and species conservation. Much of the proposed study will involve female undergraduate researchers from Wellesley College who will be exposed to research in integrative biology. These students will be encouraged to present at national meetings and publish their contribution in peer-reviewed journals. The award will support inquiry-based learning in the classroom, and will also expose undergraduate and high school students from underrepresented groups to scientific research.<br/><br/>The specific goal of the proposed study is to determine the genetic mechanism underlying the evolution of an artificially selected polyphenism. In this study, the transcriptomes of the neuroendocrine complex in a monophenic strain of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, and the polyphenic strain will be compared, as these strains differ in the temperature sensitivity of juvenile hormone production. Once candidate temperature-sensitive genes are identified, the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum and RNA interference techniques will be used to functionally characterize these genes. The project will uncover the genetic basis of genetic accommodation and identify the molecular nature of hidden genetic variation, which remains poorly understood. It will lead to a mechanistic understanding of genotype-phenotype-environment interactions and advance understanding of molecular and physiological control of juvenile hormone production. Determining the molecular nature of genetic accommodation and phenotypic plasticity has implications for our understanding of evolution. The findings may also help identify novel regulators of juvenile hormone that could serve as potential targets for pest management. By involving high school and college students in the research and integrating teaching with research, the project also contributes to training the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002628.xml,Collaborative Research: Conformational Equilibria of Biologically Important Saccharides and Related Biomolecules,NSF,2020-08-15,2023-07-31,72000,"With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Anthony Serianni from the University of Notre Dame and Dr. Robert Woods from the University of Georgia to investigate the three-dimensional properties of sugar molecules, or saccharides, in solution. Saccharides embedded in cell surfaces play critical roles in biology.  In humans, they are attached to soluble and membrane associated proteins and lipids, and their biological roles include cell-to-cell and immune recognition. While it is well known that the structural properties of saccharides correlate with their biological functions, it remains difficult to assign these structural details in solution by experimental methods. This difficulty has led to a heavy reliance on theoretical methods to assign structures even though these methods have been difficult to validate experimentally. This project aims to solve this problem by developing and applying a new experimental technique to determine populations of flexible domains in saccharides in solution, including the linkages connecting them together in polymers and linkages that attach them to other biomolecules. The experiment-derived information obtained can be compared to what is obtained from theory to test and/or validate the latter. Senior researchers, graduate students and undergraduates with interests and expertise in experimental and computational science collaborate to achieve the objectives of the project. This work provides valuable new tools to determine molecular structure that can be generally applied to any biomolecule in solution, including proteins and nucleic acids.<br/><br/>This research project uses stable isotopically labeled oligosaccharides and glycopeptides, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spin-couplings, density functional theory calculations, circular statistics and X-ray crystallography to determine conformational populations of the flexible domains of oligosaccharides in solution. This experimental approach is possible because saccharides contain multiple NMR spin-couplings that report on the same conformational domain, allowing quantitative treatments that yield continuous single- and multi-state populational models. Once a given domain is parameterized (e.g., O- or N-glycosidic linkage), its conformational properties can be investigated in different structural contexts to determine the degree to which it adapts conformationally to environmental cues. Experimental models are compared to those obtained from molecular dynamics simulations to validate the latter. This work leads to new experiment-based conformational classifications of O-glycosidic linkages in oligosaccharides, and to a deeper understanding of the multiple factors that influence oligosaccharide conformation in solution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An ideal window should seasonally respond to the solar heat, while transmitting the visible light. However, current window technologies are challenged to modulate solar heat independent of visible light. Recent advances in nanomaterials have demonstrated the ability to independently manipulate NIR light. This project will integrate the nanoscale physical relations and effects of nanomaterials on the thermal and optical behaviors of multi-layer glazing structures. The societal impacts of the project will constitute a new class of building windows that can greatly reduce the total building energy consumption in the nation. The educational impacts will include courses concentrating on building windows and envelopes, which bridge the knowledge and ignite collaborative interest between the architecture and engineering communities for cultivating future professionals in the sustainable building industry. Furthermore, experimental modules will be created to teach high school students to build their own sensors for window measurements and to raise community and public awareness of energy-efficient window technology.<br/><br/>To achieve the objective, the research approach includes: (1) decomposing global solar irradiance into its spectral band components to achieve a time-dependent NIR model; (2) deriving and experimentally validating the fundamental thermal and optical behaviors of NIR-selective glazing structures; and (3) integrating the thermo-optical model and NIR model for the evaluation and optimization of dynamic NIR-selective glazing structures. This research will form the foundation to understand the combined effects of nanoscale phenomenon (i.e., photoexcitation) and micro-to-macroscale glazing structure properties (i.e., glazing properties, spectral emissivity, central-layer insulating abilities, layer placements). Such knowledge will significantly improve our ability to incorporate NIR-selective materials into building windows. New analytical models that take the nanoscale NIR absorption and scattering features into account will be developed and experimentally validated. By coupling the developed solar spectral decomposition model and computational method to quantify glazing performance, this research will provide an understanding of the salient characteristics and patterns of the optimal time-dependent thermo-optical properties of NIR-selective glazing structures to achieve a minimum level of energy use.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The interaction of a shock wave with compressible turbulence is relevant to a wide range of engineering applications including aeronautics (supersonic flight and propulsion), energy (fusion), medicine (shock wave lithotripsy), and space physics (star formation and supernovae explosions).  Understanding the physics of the interaction between a shock wave and a homogeneous field of acoustic waves (shock/acoustics interaction) are of major theoretical and practical importance.  Given that the coexistence of shock waves with background acoustic noise is an almost unavoidable feature for any experiments conducted in supersonic wind tunnels, the study of shock/acoustics interaction is particularly important to the characterization of background acoustic disturbances in supersonic wind tunnels and to the extrapolation of measurement data obtained in noisy supersonic wind tunnels to free flight. The experiences and results gained from the research effort are being incorporated into education activities including classroom teaching, research training, and outreach activities via involvement in Missouri S&amp;T Student Diversity, Outreach and Women?s Programs in order to engage students to consider careers in STEM fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research project, significant flow characteristics associated with a homogeneous field of acoustic waves passing through a nominally normal shock wave are quantified using direct numerical simulations and linear interaction analysis. The full-fledged nonlinear simulations and the linear analysis are enabled by a pre-cursor numerical database of boundary-layer acoustic radiation that provides incident acoustic fields with a high degree of physical realism and applicability. This study advances the state of the art knowledge of shock/acoustics interaction, including (1) the generic statistical and spectral features of the post-shock fluctuations and their dependence on flow parameters; (2) the distinctions between linear and nonlinear mechanisms; and (3) the transfer function associated with the total pressure and the contribution of individual Kovasznay modes to the post-shock total pressure. This research contributes to the fundamental understanding of the interaction of a shock wave with a field of turbulence by characterizing its behaviors in the pure dilatational limit and complements existing studies of shock/turbulence interaction with a vorticity-dominated incident turbulent field. The project also provides the basis for measuring tunnel freestream noise with intrusive probes in noisy supersonic wind tunnels and for elucidating the impact of facility noise on the experimental data obtained in such wind tunnels."

The biosensing platform will be integrated with multi-modal sensing including electrical and optical detectors which will allow to correct for inherent device-to-device variation to improve sensor performance. Immune cells conjugated with functionalized nano-barcoded particles will be quantified simultaneously with an impedance detector and smartphone image sensor. Further, the proposed biosensor will be equipped with real-time data analysis using machine learning to enable a reconfigurable system for resource optimization and biomarker selection. An integrated biochip will be used to perform reconfigurable multiplexing and quantify multiple inflammatory biomarkers from patient blood samples. The proposed sensor will enable multiplexed cellular antigen classification from a drop of whole blood with time to result (TOR) for less than 30 minutes. Sensors will be benchmarked with patient clinical samples. Furthermore, it is envisioned that the biosensor platform to be generic and reconfigurable with pre-functionalized cartridges that can be swapped out for different infectious diseases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2003182.xml,MLWiNS: Resource Constrained Mobile Data Analytics Assisted by the Wireless Edge,NSF,2020-07-01,2024-06-30,300000,"Increasing amounts of data are being collected on mobile telephones and internet-of-things (IoT) devices. Users are interested in analyzing this data to extract actionable information, for example, identifying objects of interest from high-resolution mobile phone pictures. The state-of-the-art technique for such data analysis is via deep learning which makes use of sophisticated software algorithms modeled on the functioning of the human brain. Deep learning algorithms are, however, too complex to run on small, battery constrained mobile devices. The alternative, i.e., transmitting data to the mobile base station where the deep learning algorithm can be executed on a powerful server, consumes too much bandwidth. This project seeks to devise new methods to compress data before transmission, thus reducing bandwidth costs while still allowing for the data to be analyzed at the base station. Departing from existing data compression methods optimized for reproducing the original images, the project will use deep learning itself to compress the data in a fashion that only keeps the critical parts of data necessary for subsequent analysis. The resulting deep learning based compression algorithms will be simple enough to run on mobile devices while drastically reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted to mobile base stations for analysis, without significantly compromising the analysis performance. The proposed research will provide greater capability and functionality to mobile device users, enable extended battery lifetimes, and more efficient sharing of the wireless spectrum for analytics tasks. The project also envisions a multi-pronged effort aimed at outreach to communities of interest, educating and training the next generation of machine learning and wireless professionals at the K-12, undergraduate and graduate levels, and broadening participation of under-represented minority groups.<br/><br/>The project seeks to learn “analytics-aware” compression schemes from data by training low-complexity compressor deep neural networks (DNNs) that execute on mobile devices and achieve a range of transmission rate and analytics accuracy targets. As a first step, efficient DNN pruning techniques will be developed to minimize the DNN complexity, while maintaining the rate-accuracy efficiency for one or a collection of analytics tasks. Next, to efficiently adapt to varying wireless channel conditions, the project will seek to design adaptive DNN architectures that can operate at variable transmission rates and computational complexities. For instance, when the wireless channel quality drops, the proposed compression scheme will be able to quickly reduce transmission rate in response while ensuring the same analytics accuracy, but at the cost of greater computational power on the mobile device. Further, wireless channel allocation and scheduling policies that leverage the proposed adaptive DNN architectures will be developed to optimize the overall analytics accuracy at the server. The benefits of the proposed approach in terms of total battery life savings for the mobile device will be demonstrated using detailed simulation studies of various wireless protocols including those used for LTE (Long Term Evolution) and mmWave channels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They were pulled up with nets, scooped up from seabeds with grabs, and hand-collected by divers, all contributing to a library of biodiversity that captures the state of life in the ocean - year after year, decade after decade. The broadest evolutionary scope of those collections is in the marine invertebrates, animals without backbones - sea stars, corals, worms, jellyfish, crabs, and thousands of other animals. That library of preserved marine invertebrates is our essential guide to the diversity of ocean life across the globe. And because they encapsulate data from the moment they were picked up, these institutional collections also act as a time machine, letting us use the past to understand how our present will become the future. But there is a problem - vast numbers of these specimens are essentially invisible outside of a tiny community of museum specialists. The only record of these specimens' existence is on labels enclosed in the jars with the preserved animals or in paper logbooks on a shelf. These specimens will remain nearly undiscoverable on museum shelves until their core descriptive information is made digitally available. Therefore, this project will create public digital records for over 7.5 million specimens from our nation's legacy of marine exploration, thereby making the immense investment in the specimens' acquisition available to 21st Century biodiversity and ecosystems research. Because these specimens provide a visible and tangible window into our oceans' enchanting biodiversity, this project will involve STEM educators and student educators in the digitization effort, so that they will be able to reflect their science experiences directly back to the classroom. The public will be involved virtually, by contributing transcription of specimen label data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digitization of alcohol-preserved marine specimens has never been carried out on this scale. A major challenge lies in the location of the data: written, typed, or printed on labels in the jars with the specimens. In many cases, that will require opening the jar, extracting the label, and either transcribing it directly or photographing it for later transcription - for hundreds of thousands of jars. The immediate participants in this program will digitize most or all of the marine invertebrate collections at nineteen institutions across the country, more than doubling the number of digital records for marine invertebrates in the U.S. All data will be publicly available through existing data portals, including iDigBio.org, using standardized data formats, thereby dramatically enhancing the accessibility of biodiversity data for comprehensive, systems-based analysis of ocean ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2000129.xml,Classifying *-Homomorphisms,NSF,2020-06-01,2024-05-31,178590,"This project relates to the classification and structure of amenable operator algebras.  Operator algebras is an area of mathematics which began with the work of Murray and von Neumann in the 1930's motivated in part by Heisenberg's approach to quantum mechanics in terms of infinite matrices.  Von Neumann's development of operators on a Hilbert space put Heisenberg's ideas on rigorous foundations.  In this theory, the observable data is represented by certain operators (i.e. infinite matrices) on a Hilbert space.  One of the most famous concepts of quantum mechanics is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle that the speed and position of a particle cannot be known simultaneously.  The mathematically rigorous version of this statement is that the operators P and Q which measure position and momentum do not commute; i.e. PQ and QP are not equal (there is, however, a precise formula relating P and Q).  Operator algebras is the study of algebraic relations between collections of operators.  Amenable operators algebras form a particularly important class of operators algebras.  In recent years, there has been a substantial work in classifying simple amenable operator algebras. In a certain sense, the simple examples are the basic building blocks of the theory.  The goal of this project is to understand the relations between the simple amenable operator algebras (such as ways one can be embedded into the other) and the symmetries of such algebras and to exploit these ideas to uncover structural information about operator algebras as a whole. This project also will be contributing to the education of the US workforce through the training of graduate students.<br/><br/>More technically, recent progress in Elliott's Program shows separable, simple, nuclear, regular C*-algebras in the UCT class are classified up to isomorphism via their operator K-theory groups, their trace simplex, and the pairing between them.  This should be viewed as a direct analogue to the Connes-Haagerup classification of separably acting injective factors in terms of their type and flow of weights.  The Connes-Haagerup classification has become a corner stone of modern von Neumann algebra theory, and the C*-algebraic analogue may be expected to have an equally important role in C*-algebra theory.  In recent joint work with Carrion, Gabe, Tikuisis, and White, the PI showed that embeddings of ""classifiable"" C*-algebras are determined up to approximate unitary equivalence by K-theoretic data.  The aim of this project is to refine and expand on these techniques with an eye towards equivariant classification and non-simple classification, as well as applications to the regularity theory, such as computing the nuclear dimension of a new classes of C*-algebras.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001650.xml,Laser-Cooling-Driven Opto-Thermophoretic Tweezers,NSF,2020-09-01,2024-08-31,411585,"Optical tweezers won the 2018 Nobel Prize in physics for their applications in biological systems. The tweezers use a highly focused laser beam to trap and manipulate small objects, including cells, particles, bacteria, and virus. Despite the huge success of optical tweezers, the requirement of sophisticated optical setups and high working power prevent their non-invasive manipulation of fragile objects. Tremendous efforts have been made to develop new techniques for optical trapping. However, a universal strategy to safely manipulate different particles and cells in various liquid environments is still elusive. This proposal aims to develop a new optical tweezing platform based on laser cooling and thermal migration of particles in a temperature gradient. Laser cooling can create a localized cold spot on a substrate where various particles can be trapped by thermophoresis. The cooling-induced trapping is expected to effectively avoid the thermal damages due to optical heating in conventional optical tweezer, and the general thermophoretic migration behavior allows this strategy to be used for a wide range of biological cells and nanoparticles to advance life sciences and biomedical applications, including tissue engineering, cellular biology, early disease diagnosis, and drug delivery. The proposed research at the interfaces of physics, photonics, thermo-fluidics, colloidal sciences, and biology will provide interdisciplinary research opportunities for graduate students, undergraduate students, and K-12 students. The outreach efforts will be integrated into two existing Women in Engineering Program initiatives on campus to increase recruiting women and underrepresented minorities into engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Opto-thermophoretic tweezers were recently developed as an alternative strategy to manipulate particles and cells in a light-controlled temperature gradient with simple optics and low operation power. However, the current laser-heating-based opto-thermophoretic tweezers suffer from limited applicability to special solvent conditions and potential optothermal damages. The objective of this proposal is to develop and apply new opto-thermophoretic tweezers based on laser cooling of the substrates. Due to the common thermophobia in colloidal species, a variety of biological cells and particles can be trapped at the laser beams via thermophoresis in their native environments. In addition, this design can avoid thermal damages due to the temperature increase in optical tweezers and the heating-based opto-thermophoretic tweezers. The proposed research will provide a novel platform for versatile and non-invasive optical manipulation for nanoparticles and biological cells. The intellectual merit is that the proposed research will improve fundamental understanding of laser cooling and thermophoresis, establish safe optical manipulation techniques for cells in biological media, and advance biological applications of optical tweezers, including studies of cell-cell interactions and thermal cues in cellular behaviors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PI’s research explores the relation of questions about solutions to equations (in particular, how many solutions certain kinds of equations have) with questions about geometry of certain kinds of spaces; in turn, another side of the PI’s proposed research investigates the ways geometry of high-dimensional spaces can be brought to bear on other problems in mathematics and data science which might not immediately ""look like"" geometry.  The PI’s research is closely entwined with his work as a popularizer of mathematics in print, broadcast, and social media; he is currently working on a book about geometry which will involve some of the funded research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project covers a wide range of problems in number theory, algebraic geometry, and data science.  A central part is the work of PI and collaborators on a theory of height for rational points on algebraic stacks.  The definition was pinned down and its properties studied during the previous granting period; during the present period, we will state a general heuristic for asymptotically counting points on stacks of bounded height, and work towards proving new cases.  This new conjecture will include as special cases the Malle conjectures (how many number fields are there of discriminant at most X?) and the Batyrev-Manin conjectures (how many solutions are there to a given equation in integers all of which are at most X?)  but applies to many new cases besides, and sheds new light even on the classical questions.  In particular, our work adds to the developing consensus that we should go beyond heights attached to line bundles and study the variation of heights attached to vector bundles of arbitrary rank, opening up whole new directions of research and revealing new connections between existing sectors of the literature.  The project also includes a wide range of problems in other areas, including group theory (an attempt to use the method of “FI-groups” to prove property T for new families of groups, following the breakthrough of Kaluba, Kielak, and Nowak for Out(F_n)), arithmetic statistics (proving new results towards the Bhargava-Kane-Lenstra-Poonen-Rains conjectures on variation of Selmer groups in the function field case), multilinear algebra (understanding the algebraic and convex geometry of the locus of low-slice-rank tensors), and data science (investigation of what popular machine learning protocols do and don’t learn about symmetry from their input).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The bacteria may manipulate their insect hosts’ reproduction in ways that improves the health or number of female hosts carrying the bacterium. Relevant to this study, these bacterial “symbionts” can sabotage host sperm such that fertilized eggs laid by females without the bacterium die early in life (“cytoplasmic incompatibility,” or “CI”). Currently, two common, unrelated bacteria are known to cause CI in insects: Wolbachia, and Cardinium hertigii, the focus of this study. The main goal of this project is to discover the molecular mechanism by which Cardinium causes CI in insects. The benefits of this work are at least two-fold. Bacteria such as Cardinium target animal cell division, a fundamental process that can be understood better when examining how Cardinium interferes with it. Secondly, CI-causing bacteria may be used for pest or vector management. The CI agent Wolbachia reduces the susceptibility to viruses of insects that carry it, and is currently being introduced around the world to mosquito populations, with major implications for reduction of vector-borne disease and the global bioeconomy. The project will also provide engaging science education targeted for under-represented groups through outreach programs for elementary school (U Arizona Insect Discovery and Insect Festival), high school (production of a book “Animal Manipulating Parasites at NC State, and Iowa State George Washington Carver Internship program) and undergraduate students (via research opportunities at all three institutions). <br/><br/>For Cardinium strains that infect Encarsia spp., parasitic wasps of whiteflies, genomic and transcriptomic studies have identified candidate genes that are likely to be important in CI and/or symbiosis. The central hypotheses are that (1) Cardinium effector proteins involved in modifying host DNA during spermatogenesis are associated with the testes, and other Cardinium effectors involved with rescue of modified sperm are present in the ovaries of infected wasps, (2) the role of these proteins can be inferred by identifying the host proteins they interact with and (3) that the B vitamin biotin has a critical role in CI and/or the symbiosis. The project presents a unique opportunity to test these hypotheses with a diverse array of approaches, in four objectives: (1) Compare Cardinium localization and CI candidate gene expression in male pupal Encarsia, the “modification” stage, with patterns observed in adults.(2) Identify Cardinium and Encarsia proteins involved in CI with differential proteomics. (3) Use heterologous expression to identify interacting host proteins of CI candidate proteins. (4) Investigate the role of Cardinium synthesized biotin in modification of host proteins. This project will shed light on the sophisticated CI reproductive manipulation by Cardinium. Cardinium has received comparatively little attention, but produces a virtually identical CI phenotype to Wolbachia with what appears to be completely independent eukaryote-interacting genes, a plasmid and not a phage, and an unusual type 6 secretion system. What is learned about Cardinium candidate gene function, expression and host targets will illuminate CI and symbiosis in both systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001208.xml,Advancing Methods for Analyzing Coordination: New Developments in Global Game Theory.,NSF,2019-07-01,2021-08-31,113866,"This award funds research in economic theory, with a focus on coordination games. This theory can be used to analyze a wide variety of economic problems, including financial crises and business cycles. While the standard coordination game approach offers insight into these settings, it allows multiple equilibria and thus does not offer a complete theory in the absence of a theory of equilibrium selection. In response, a global games approach has been widely used in applied economics. By assuming noisy information about payoffs, one can remove the multiplicity of equilibria and develop a wide variety of predictions that can then be tested against data. However, there are a number of important limitations to the global games approach. The four components of this research proposal address four different limitations. The components are relevant for all global game applications, but are developed in the context of applications in macroeconomics, political economy and finance.  The project therefore contributes to developing new theories and methods that can help individuals, businesses, and policymakers at all levels of government make better decisions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Global game analysis has made extreme informational assumptions: there is common knowledge of payoffs and multiple equilibria, or small noise and globally unique equilibria. The project has four components, each designed to address one aspect of these assumptions. The first component examines richer classes of information structures to develop novel predictions about when global game predictions arise. Global game analysis has been primarily static. The second component examines dynamic environments with learning to develop predictions about when global game predictions occur. Global game analysis has focused on binary action games. The third component analyzes a political economy application where feasible set of available actions is itself a choice variable, and characterizes when the action set is or is not binary. Global game analysis has mostly relied on simple analytic solutions to deliver qualitative insights. The fourth component develops a finance application with a rich set of heterogeneous players in order to develop quantitative framework that that can be used in empirical work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002964.xml,GOALI: Designing Adaptive Hydrogen-bonded Frameworks for Molecular Structure Determination,NSF,2020-05-01,2025-04-30,502215,"Non-Technical Summary. The structure of molecules is central to chemistry, recognized since the pioneering efforts of 19th century scientists such as Jacobus Henricus van't Hoff, who formulated the structure of the tetrahedral carbon atom, and Louis Pasteur, who unraveled the relationship between molecular chirality and their corresponding crystal forms. Chirality, a property typically associated with the spatial arrangement of four different groups about a carbon atom, is essential to molecules of life such as proteins and DNA, as well as pharmaceutical compounds beneficial to human health. With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, this project uses a combination of computation and experiment to design adaptive host frameworks, built from molecules, that crystallize around awkwardly shaped large guest molecules, some chiral, that otherwise cannot crystallize on their own. This approach unravels the rules for assembly of molecules into multicomponent crystals while also allowing determination of molecular structure using X-ray diffraction, providing a valuable tool to organic synthetic chemists in academic and commercial laboratories, including pharmaceutical companies that need structural information for drug development. Capitalizing on the structure of the NSF program Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI), New York University undergraduate and graduate students benefit from internships supported by the Merck Future Talent Program to gain research experience in an industrial setting at the nearby GOALI partner, Merck & Co., Inc. The project also partners with the NYU Collegiate Science and Technology Entry Program to introduce students from underrepresented groups to the structure of molecules, including creation of an educational coloring book with illustrations of molecules that are relevant to human health; provides professional development activities for students and postdocs; builds a broad-based conduit to the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras for undergraduate and graduate research; and hosts chemical crystallography workshops and master classes for the academic, government and industrial sectors. Consequently, the project benefits learners at multiple levels and widens the pipeline for opportunities and careers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics).<br/><br/>Technical Summary. Molecular frameworks, spanning metal-organic, covalent-organic and hydrogen-bonded, occupy a central role in solid-state chemistry, largely owing to the ability to tune their properties through molecular design. Hydrogen-bonded frameworks (HBFs) are unique owing to their ability to form crystalline stoichiometric inclusion compounds by encapsulating guest molecules in well-defined cavities. Hydrogen-bonded guanidinium-organosulfonate (GS) host frameworks are remarkably versatile in this respect, with an ability to capture a wide range of guest molecules in tunable cavities of frameworks with architectures that adapt to the size and shape of the guests. These characteristics provide a unique opportunity to unravel, and then deploy, the rules governing host-guest organization and solid-state structure in general. Operating under a GOALI construct, with support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, New York University and Merck & Co. investigators deploy a substantial collection of GS frameworks with an aim of devising optimization protocols – from simple geometric fitting to machine learning tools – for targeted inclusion of guest molecules through single-step crystallization of high quality single crystals. This protocol enables determination of the molecular structure of encapsulated guests, including absolute configuration of stereogenic centers, addressing a critical challenge faced by synthetic chemists in the academic and industrial sectors. Consequently, the research plan provides a springboard for an entirely new application for HBFs while revealing factors responsible for assembly and structure of inclusion compounds in general. The GOALI capitalizes on the knowledge base of Merck to determine the scope and generality of this approach with a focus on target molecules of real-world interest, whether reaction intermediates, chemical impurities, active pharmaceutical ingredients or their analogs. The methodology is disseminated to the public through publications, direct E-mail, and a stand-alone website that will announce new structure assignments, archive the results and integrate computational tools for framework selection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000997.xml,COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: Orbital-scale Variability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and the Formation of Bottom Water in the Ross Sea during the Pliocene-Pleistocene,NSF,2020-09-01,2024-08-31,125661,"Part I: Non-technical description: &lt;br/&gt;Predicting how polar ice sheets will respond to future global warming is difficult because all the processes that contribute to their melting are not well understood. This is important because the more ice on land that melts, the higher sea levels will rise. The most significant uncertainty in current estimates of sea-level rise in the coming decades is the potential contribution from the Antarctic Ice Sheet. One way to increase our knowledge about how large ice sheets respond to climate change in response to natural factors is to examine the geologic past. Natural global warming (and cooling) events in Earth’s history provide examples that we can use to better understand processes, interactions, and responses we can’t directly observe today. One such time period, approximately three million years ago (known as the Pliocene), was the last time atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were as high as they are today and, therefore, represents a time period to study to better understand the ice sheet response to a warming climate. Specifically, this project is interested in understanding how ocean currents near Antarctica, which transport heat and store carbon, behaved during these past climate events. The history of past ice sheet-ocean interactions are recorded in sediments that were deposited, layer upon layer, in the deep sea offshore Antarctica. In January-February 2018, a team of scientists and crew set sail to the Ross Sea, offshore west Antarctica, on the scientific ocean drilling vessel JOIDES Resolution to recover such sediment archives. This project focuses on a sediment core from that expedition, which captures the relatively warm Pliocene time interval, as well as the subsequent transition into cooler climates typical of the past two million years. The researchers will analyze the sediment with multiple complementary measurements, including: grain size, composition, chemistry of organic matter, physical structures, microfossil type and abundance, and more. These analyses will be done by the research team, including several students, at their respective laboratories and will then integrated into a unified record of ice sheet-ocean interactions. Ultimately, the results will be used to improve modeled projections of how the Antarctic Ice Sheet could respond to future climate change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part II: Technical description: &lt;br/&gt;Geological records from the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) margin demonstrate that the ice sheet oscillated in response to orbital variations in insolation (i.e., ~400, 100, 41, and 20 kyr), and it appears to be more sensitive to specific frequencies that regulate mean annual insolation (i.e., 41-kyr obliquity), particularly when the ice sheet extends into marine environments and is impacted by ocean circulation. However, the relationship between orbital forcing and the production of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) is unconstrained. Thus, a knowledge gap exists in understanding how changing insolation impacts ice marginal and Southern Ocean conditions that directly influence ventilation of the global ocean. The researchers hypothesize that insolation-driven changes directly affected the production and export of AABW to the Southern Ocean from the Pliocene through the Pleistocene. For example, obliquity amplification during the warmer Pliocene may have led to enhanced production and export of dense waters from the shelf due to reduced AIS extent, which, in turn, led to greater AABW outflow. To determine the relationship of AABW production to orbital regime, they plan to reconstruct both from a single, continuous record from the levee of Hillary Canyon, a major conduit of AABW outflow, on the Ross Sea continental rise. To test their hypothesis, they will analyze sediment from IODP Site U1524 (recovered in 2018 during International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 374) and focus on three data sets. (1) They will use the occurrence, frequency, and character of mm-scale turbidite beds as a proxy of dense-shelf-water cascading outflow and AABW production. They will estimate the down-slope flux via numerical modeling of turbidity current properties using morphology, grain size, and bed thickness as input parameters. (2) They will use grain-size data, physical properties, XRF core scanning, CT imaging, and hyperspectral imaging to guide lithofacies analysis to infer processes occurring during glacial, deglacial, and interglacial periods. Statistical techniques and optimization methods will be applied to test for astronomical forcing of sedimentary packages in order to provide a cyclostratigraphic framework and interpret the orbital-forcing regime. (3) They will use bulk sedimentary carbon and nitrogen abundance and isotope data to determine how relative contributions of terrigenous and marine organic matter change in response to orbital forcing. All of these data will be integrated with sedimentological records to deconvolve organic matter production from its deposition or remobilization due to AABW outflow as a function of the oscillating extent of the AIS. These data sets will be integrated into a unified chronostratigraphy to determine the relationship between AABW outflow and orbital-forcing scenarios under the varying climate regimes of the Plio-Pleistocene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, chemical tethers are used to link an unnatural amino acid (one that is not found in terrestrial organisms) to another amino acid along the chain to constrain the shape of the peptide.  The resulting peptides have potential applications in materials science, as catalysts and in drug development. In addition, the project prepares students to enter the science workforce through the development of a series of training workshops that help students practice professional skills, provide career guidance, and promote diversity and inclusion.<br/><br/>The research project employs a new strategy for side-chain-mediated cross-linking, or “stapling,” that takes advantage of the unique conformational properties of the unnatural amino acid 4-mercaptoproline.  Multiple independent strategies are used to incorporate 4-mercaptoproline staples into peptides, producing unique varieties of stapled beta-hairpins, stapled collagen-like helices and assemblies, and stapled bicyclic peptides.  The three-dimensional structures of these designed structural scaffolds are determined by solution-state NMR spectroscopy. The effects of the new staples on biological degradation and cell penetration are examined through cell-based assays. The long term broader scientific impact of this work is to provide tools and methodology to control peptide architecture and biological stability and in so doing construct polypeptides with particular utility for studies in chemical biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002917.xml,I-Corps:  High productivity micro-reactors for large scale hydrocarbon and CO2 processing,NSF,2020-02-01,2021-05-31,50000,"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop a highly efficient, cost-effective system for direct conversion of CO2 to useful chemicals, while minimizing waste and emissions. The potential impacts include, but are not limited to, new cost-effective utilization of the abundant CO2 both within the atmosphere and from point source emissions, such as power plants, for the production of value-added chemicals. The heart of this technology is a 'microreactor' that allows process intensification and thus increased productivity compared to a conventional reactor.  Microreactors offer enhanced productivity, safety, and robustness.  The proposed unit can be developed as an easily deployable, standalone unit or to retrofit existing plants. Moreover, this project will deliver major benefits to the chemical process industries by accelerating response to market changes, simplifying scale-up, enabling rapid development and deployment of new products, simplifying on-site gas treatment and processing, and reducing the environmental impact and safety risks inherent to pipeline transportation to a central facility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on designing and building a standalone highly intensified unit to leverage the high productivity of microreactors in developing small scale Gas-To-Liquid (GTL) plants converting CO2 into value-added chemicals. A microreactor containing microchannels is ideal for process intensification in chemical engineering as it (1) enhances the heat and mass transfer processes; (2) allows precise adjustment of the initial and boundary conditions, as well as the residence or contact time for continuous chemical reactions; and (3) represents inherently safe plant operation.  The decrease in the physical dimensions (miniaturization) of a unit leads to enhanced mixing and heat exchange, thereby improving the surface area per unit volume and subsequent mass and heat transfer rates.

2001040.xml,Moduli of Differentials,NSF,2020-08-01,2023-07-31,150000,"The concept of differentials dates back to the origin of calculus.  For instance, integration of differentials can tell us about distance, area, volume, etc, for the physical world.  Nowadays the study of differentials has broad connections to a number of fields in and outside of mathematics.  It has been proven extremely useful that one should collect differentials with similar structures into a parameter space (called moduli space) and study the global properties of this space, which can in turn determine crucial information about each individual differential.  The principal investigator plans to explore new, fascinating properties of differentials as well as their moduli spaces.  Moreover, he plans to discover hidden connections between initially unrelated subjects in which differentials appear from different aspects.  The proposed project also opens many gates for student and postdoctoral research.  The principal investigator will continue to integrate his research with undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral training as well as conference organizations.  In particular, he plans to advise student research projects, design new courses, and organize a series of workshops, with a focus on increasing diversity and supporting underrepresented groups.  <br/><br/>The moduli space of differentials on Riemann surfaces can be stratified according to the types of zeros and poles.  Each stratum is equipped with a group action by varying the polygonal structure induced by a differential.  Various questions about surface geometry reduce to understanding the strata of differentials and orbits under the action.  The principal investigator plans to employ his expertise in algebraic geometry, combined with mixing techniques from analysis, dynamics and topology, to study these strata and orbits, such as their volumes, geodesics, and boundary behavior.  An ultimate goal is to establish a correspondence between dynamical invariants of differentials and intersection theory on moduli spaces.  Moreover, the PI plans to use the obtained results to analyze algebro-geometric properties of moduli spaces, such as birational types, compactifications, and tautological rings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2000613.xml,Collaborative Research: Defining and Measuring Student Trust of Instructors in College STEM Courses,NSF,2020-10-01,2024-09-30,115229,"This project aims to serve the national interest by conducting basic research to characterize key components of student trust in college STEM instructors and how that trust contributes to desired student outcomes.  The project is an EHR Core Research (ECR) Level 1 award, focused on STEM Learning and Learning Environments. A consensus is emerging about the benefits of student-centered pedagogies, like active learning, for students in college classrooms.  However, less is known about how psychological and social factors in a classroom affect student outcomes. Furthermore, psychosocial factors may be particularly important in innovative teaching contexts where students are learning in new, unfamiliar ways. This project targets the multidimensional psychosocial variable of trust. Most existing educational studies on trust focus on primary/secondary school contexts and examine trust indirectly through student-teacher interactions or through the teacher or organization, instead of the student. The limited previous efforts in college environments have examined whether college students perceive their relationship with their instructor as a trusting one, as defined by understanding, acceptance, and care. Such efforts showed that trust predicted student buy-in to course material, course engagement, final course grade, and intent to persist in science.  Interestingly, trust was more important in achieving these outcomes than other variables such as growth mindset. However, this previous definition of trust does not include other key dimensions of trust or the dynamics of trust-building. This project seeks to examine college students’ trust in their instructor by using a more comprehensive theoretical framework of trust. Utilizing this framework, trust building between students and instructors in college STEM courses will be facilitated, and the impact of trust on desired student outcomes will be assessed. It is anticipated that this work will advance research on student trust within the college STEM course environment, and examine how building trust positively impacts student engagement, learning, and persistence.<br/><br/>This research unifies theories from the education and psychology research literatures to define trust more fully in an undergraduate STEM course context. It seeks to address two important research questions: 1) What are the key dimensions of student trust of an instructor in large college STEM classrooms? and 2) How does student trust in the instructor relate to important student outcome variables (e.g., student commitment, engagement, intent to persist in STEM, and final course grade), and are there differential impacts for students from groups underrepresented in STEM fields as compared to other groups of students? This project targets large enrollment college STEM courses, not only because these courses are where most STEM students in the nation are taught (majors and non-majors alike), but also because large enrollment courses such as these can make it particularly challenging to develop “one-to-many” (i.e., “instructor-to-students”) trust relationships. To broadly define and measure trust, this research will be conducted in courses operating as traditional lectures as well as those using new, evidence-based teaching practices. This project intends to use a mixed methods approach for instructor and student data collection. Specifically, it will proceed through a process of taxonomy development, instrument construction, and instrument validation to create and iteratively improve a measure of student trust for use in higher education contexts. The expected result is the initial establishment of a comprehensive yet parsimonious measure of college students’ trust in their instructor. This project has the potential to serve the STEM education community’s ongoing emphasis on finding ways to increase students’ commitment and engagement in student-centered classrooms and in STEM majors more broadly. The proposed project is a joint effort between researchers at Yale University and the University of Connecticut and is supported by the ECR program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Thermal and Fluids Engineering Conference (TFEC) is an annual conference since 2015 that has grown to become a leading platform for presentation and discussion of research advances in thermal and fluids engineering. In 2020, the conference will take place April 5-8, 2020 in New Orleans, LA. The annual TFEC conference addresses the need for a platform for dissemination and discussion of research results in the fields of heat transfer and fluid mechanics. A number of sessions encompassing the breadth of thermal and fluid transport are currently being organized for the conference. The proposed NSF support will enable a significant intellectual benefit and professional development opportunity for a number of students and early career engineers/faculty from around the country.

2001486.xml,Moduli Spaces and Galois Theory in Arithmetic Dynamics,NSF,2020-05-15,2021-01-31,116762,"Arithmetic dynamics is a relatively new discipline that brings together two major areas of mathematics: number theory, traditionally the study of the integers and integer (or rational) solutions to polynomial equations, and discrete dynamical systems, where one studies the long term behavior of functions under repeated iteration. This project will further develop and combine two facets of arithmetic dynamics: one is geometric in nature, using geometric objects (moduli spaces) to classify dynamical systems with specified dynamical behaviors, and the other is algebraic, understanding algebraic symmetries (Galois theory) associated to dynamical systems. The fields of number theory and, to some extent, arithmetic dynamics have found uses in cryptography and related areas. The PI will continue outreach activities with the aim of using cryptography as a means of introducing a more general audience to interesting mathematics. This project is jointly funded by the Algebra and Number Theory program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of arithmetic dynamics is heavily motivated by analogies between arithmetic geometry and dynamical systems. One important such connection is that preperiodic points for endomorphisms of projective space play a role similar to torsion points on elliptic curves (or, more generally, abelian varieties). The focus of this project is to further investigate this analogy from the moduli-theoretic and Galois-theoretic perspectives. The PI has been involved with the development of the theory of moduli spaces that parametrize endomorphisms with marked preperiodic points -- analogous to classical modular curves, which parametrize elliptic curves with marked torsion points. Such moduli spaces have already played a fundamental role in progress toward the dynamical uniform boundedness conjecture of Morton and Silverman, a dynamical analogue of the Mazur-Merel strong uniform boundedness theorem for torsion points on elliptic curves. In order to make further progress on this difficult uniform boundedness problem, the PI proposes to study the geometry of dynamical moduli spaces attached to certain dynamically interesting families of functions (e.g., quadratic rational maps with a critical point of a given period). The analogy between preperiodic points and torsion points also lends itself to a dynamical analogue of Serre's open image theorem, a finite-index result for the adelic Galois representation associated to torsion points on elliptic curves. The PI proposes studying the appropriate Galois representation attached to (pre)periodic points for rational maps -- especially in the function field setting, where results will provide new insights into the geometry of dynamical moduli spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002437.xml,Collaborative Research: How Robust Are Common-Era Sea-Level Reconstructions?,NSF,2020-06-01,2023-05-31,357755,"Sea-level rise is one of the most challenging aspects of climate change.  In order to be confident in predictions of future sea level estimates, it is important to clearly understand how and why sea level changed naturally in the past. This project will collect field data and perform computer modeling to improve our understanding of the main factors that control average sea level during the Common Era (past ~2,000 years). For example, changes in wind and ocean currents, water temperature, and the rebound of land surfaces caused by removing the weight of ice or sediments all contribute to changes in the record of sea level at any location.  This project will examine the origin and nature of uncertainties that enter into sea level reconstructions based on errors in estimating each of these factors in the past. The project will not only help scientists improve our understanding of the causes of sea level changes, but it also will help coastal planners by providing better models for projecting sea-level changes into the future. The project will also support three young scientists, deepening their field, laboratory, and modeling skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding sea level during the Common Era is central to establishing the uniqueness of modern sea-level rise related to anthropogenic climate change, identifying links between sea level and natural climate variability, and training semi-empirical models of future sea-level rise. Past studies estimate global-mean sea level during the Common Era using proxy records. These estimates differ substantially in terms of global-mean sea-level variability during pre-industrial times. It remains to establish how sensitive these estimates are to various uncertainties, assumptions, and choices involved in producing global-mean sea-level time series from the raw data. A detailed study of the robustness and reproducibility of Common-Era sea-level reconstructions based on field, laboratory, and modeling analyses is proposed. Objectives include: (1) determine the reproducibility of high-resolution salt-marsh sea-level reconstructions; and (2) quantify the robustness of model estimates of Common-Era global-mean sea level. Outcomes will fill basic knowledge gaps, advancing understanding of the Common Era, and leading to better characterization of trends, patterns, and causes of pre- and post-industrial sea-level change. By documenting past spatiotemporal variability of sea level, evaluating associated rates of change during the Common Era, and identifying links to ocean circulation and climate, the project will contribute to achieving the goals and scientific objectives of the Paleo Perspectives on Climate Change (P2C2) program. Efforts will make progress towards the broader goals of sea-level research related to the sensitivity of ice sheets to climate change, the response of the solid Earth to redistribution of ice mass, and the assimilation of proxy records and instrumental observations within a coherent probabilistic framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The atmosphere converts pollutants by processing them into water-soluble products that are removed through precipitation (rain or snow) or by deposition onto Earth’s surface. This chemical conversion of pollution happens through a sunlight-driven (photochemical) process known as oxidation. Most of what is known about these atmospheric processes comes from measurements made at the surface in Arctic coastal environments. The CHACHA team plans to use two instrumented aircraft to conduct airborne measurements around the Chukchi Sea, the Beaufort Sea, and the Alaska North Slope region. They plan to target features that are rapidly changing - above and downwind of sea ice ""leads"" (areas of open water in otherwise sea-ice-covered ocean regions), and downwind of sources of combustion-derived pollutants. Researchers will also use collected data to develop atmospheric models that will be openly available for use by the broader scientific community. The team is composed of researchers at six United States universities (in Alaska, Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and New York) and will mentor a diverse group of students and postdoctoral scholars. Researchers will also engage in several additional education and outreach activities, including an “aircraft open house” and an annual three-day Science Fair in Utqiaġvik, AK. Overall, this project will enable the United States to better understand how rapid change in the Arctic impacts the chemical composition of the atmosphere and to translate what was learned to other regions - including the atmosphere above the world's oceans and in Earth's upper atmosphere.

Aircraft will conduct complementary sampling upwind and downwind of leads (sea ice fractures), over snow-covered tundra, and downwind of the North Slope of Alaska oilfields. Sampling will occur at various altitudes from the near-surface through the boundary layer and into the free troposphere. The team will prioritize measurement of various greenhouse gases (including O3, CO2, CH4, H2O), reactive trace gases (including NO2, SO2, N2O5, HO2NO2, bromine- and chlorine-containing gases), aerosol size distributions and composition, cloud residual particle composition, and cloud particle size distributions, as well as atmospheric data.

The broadest evolutionary scope of those collections is in the marine invertebrates, animals without backbones - sea stars, corals, worms, jellyfish, crabs, and thousands of other animals. That library of preserved marine invertebrates is our essential guide to the diversity of ocean life across the globe. And because they encapsulate data from the moment they were picked up, these institutional collections also act as a time machine, letting us use the past to understand how our present will become the future. But there is a problem - vast numbers of these specimens are essentially invisible outside of a tiny community of museum specialists. The only record of these specimens' existence is on labels enclosed in the jars with the preserved animals or in paper logbooks on a shelf. These specimens will remain nearly undiscoverable on museum shelves until their core descriptive information is made digitally available. Therefore, this project will create public digital records for over 7.5 million specimens from our nation's legacy of marine exploration, thereby making the immense investment in the specimens' acquisition available to 21st Century biodiversity and ecosystems research. Because these specimens provide a visible and tangible window into our oceans' enchanting biodiversity, this project will involve STEM educators and student educators in the digitization effort, so that they will be able to reflect their science experiences directly back to the classroom. The public will be involved virtually, by contributing transcription of specimen label data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digitization of alcohol-preserved marine specimens has never been carried out on this scale. A major challenge lies in the location of the data: written, typed, or printed on labels in the jars with the specimens. In many cases, that will require opening the jar, extracting the label, and either transcribing it directly or photographing it for later transcription - for hundreds of thousands of jars. The immediate participants in this program will digitize most or all of the marine invertebrate collections at nineteen institutions across the country, more than doubling the number of digital records for marine invertebrates in the U.S. All data will be publicly available through existing data portals, including iDigBio.org, using standardized data formats, thereby dramatically enhancing the accessibility of biodiversity data for comprehensive, systems-based analysis of ocean ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002642.xml,Collaborative Research: Disentangling physical and biological controls on Indian Ocean carbon storage during the last glacial-interglacial transition,NSF,2020-08-01,2024-07-31,128645,"Evidence suggests more carbon dioxide was stored in deep ocean waters during the last ice age and released to the atmosphere as the Earth warmed. There are several ways that this might happen. Carbon dioxide could be released when the total amount of algae in ocean waters decreases after the last ice age. Or the amount of carbon dioxide stored in the deeper ocean waters could change with differing pathways of deep currents.  Recent work suggest the Indian Ocean might play an important role in one or both of these processes. Newly collected sediment cores collected from the Indian Ocean will be examined for subtle changes in the chemistry that will provide scientists a way to document how carbon dioxide moves between the oceans and atmosphere over long periods of time. The social media platform of the American Museum of Natural History will be used to produce short video segments and visualizations of ocean circulation and climate to share with educators and the general public.  <br/><br/>The question of physical versus biological controls of CO2 sequestration in the glacial ocean remains unresolved after decades of research. During glaciations, changes in thermohaline circulation, Southern Ocean ventilation, and nutrient utilization are all believed to have played an important role in reducing atmospheric CO2. An improved understanding of the different roles of biological transfer versus physical transfer of CO2 requires examining multiple water masses in multiple ocean basins. The scientific objective is to reconstruct the magnitude and mechanisms driving carbon storage in the southern Indian Ocean by determining the temporal evolution and vertical distribution of Delta14C and oxygenation (using quantitative proxies: Delta-delta13Cwuel-globo, and alkenone preservation) in Indian Ocean interior water masses across the last glacial-interglacial transition. These proxies have been chosen to distinguish between the rate of water mass circulation and respiration-driven CO2 accumulation to assess the roles these mechanisms played in CO2 sequestration. The use of multiple sediment cores across latitude and longitude has been fundamental in determining that critical indicators of oceanic CO2 storage (Delta14C and oxygenation) differed substantially in the Atlantic and Pacific through time. Work proposed here will fill a substantial gap in our knowledge by making use of the first new core material from the Southern Indian Ocean in nearly 30 years. We have selected a suite of three suitable cores from depths (1,118 to 3,164 m) that are bathed by the major interior water masses that reflect both respiration and circulation driven CO2 storage in the region today. Results created here will be the first from this area using these techniques to determine the magnitude and mechanisms of Southern Indian Ocean CO2 storage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000641.xml,Examining Potential Causal Connections and Mechanisms between Children's Block Play and Mathematics Learning,NSF,2020-09-01,2023-01-31,1347370,"The purpose of this project is to further develop, refine, and evaluate a research-based STEM learning tool (i.e. block play) that tests theories of mathematical learning. Block play is common in preschool settings and is a context in which mathematics skill development may occur. Although a growing body of work has linked block play to mathematical development, there remains little causal evidence to support these relationships. The first objective of the project is to empirically evaluate the impacts of different types of block play on children’s mathematics. The second objective is to evaluate the extent to which children’s mathematical language (spatial and quantitative), spatial skills, and executive function are mechanisms that link block play with children’s mathematical learning. Results from this study will contribute to the theoretical understanding of how and why block play may influence the development of early mathematics, a key component of STEM and school readiness. Finally, this study will advance the research base about low-cost, feasible, and effective strategies for improving childrens’ mathematics learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To meet the goals of this project, the project team will conduct a randomized controlled trial in which children from low-income backgrounds will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: unstructured block play, semi-structured block play, or a business-as-usual control group. The block play sessions will be conducted with small groups of children and will be video recorded. It is hypothesized that children who participate in either of the block play conditions will demonstrate greater gains in mathematics compared to children in the business-as-usual condition. Further, it is expected that children in the semi-structured block play condition will experience greater gains in mathematics relative to children in the unstructured condition. The team will also test the extent to which mathematical language ability, spatial ability, and executive function are potential mechanisms that may underlie the association between block play and mathematics. It is hypothesized that gains in mathematical language and spatial skills will mediate the links between both intervention conditions and gains in mathematical learning. However, it is possible that executive function will only be a mechanism between the semi-structured block play condition and mathematics. The project will integrate research findings into classroom instruction, engage in-service teachers in intervention development, provide an early mathematics teacher training, and make all intervention materials publicly available.  This project is supported by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development, with co-funding by the Discovery Research PreK-12 (DRK-12) program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2003002.xml,MLWiNS: Collaborative Training and Inference at the Wireless Edge for Collective Intelligence,NSF,2020-07-01,2025-06-30,210000,"Moving data, computation, and control into the cloud has been a significant trend in the past decade. However, the Internet of Things (IoT) is generating an unprecedented volume and variety of data and hence, by the time the data makes its way to the cloud for analysis and decision making, the opportunity to act on it might be gone. Moving the data computation and analytics from the cloud to the wireless edge enables the possibility of meeting application delay requirements, improves the scalability and energy efficiency of IoT devices, and mitigates the traffic burden on the network. Machine Learning (ML) at the wireless-network edge, referred to as edge ML, emphasizes leveraging the power of local computing and using edge devices (e.g., smartphones) as edge servers to provide intelligent services (e.g., control and decision making). However, enabling ML at the network edge introduces novel fundamental challenges in terms of the joint design of model training/inference, and communication under latency/privacy. Although the project is aimed at addressing these fundamental problems, it has the potential for long-term broader impacts on basic science, education, and technology. It brings expertise from computing, communication, and machine learning to enable artificial intelligence in the Internet of Things. It also fosters collaboration between industry (e.g., Intel) and academia and hence facilitates technology transfer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ideal place to analyze most IoT data appears to be near the devices that produce and act on that data. This calls for distributed, low-latency, and reliable edge ML. The project is tasked with ML using available data at the wireless edge in two high-level scenarios, (i) federated learning, and (ii) collaborative training and inference for network-level intelligence. However, several challenges must be addressed to support edge ML, especially when considering real-time ML over limited wireless bandwidth: (i) Training data is unevenly distributed over a large number of edge devices. (ii) Every edge device has access to a tiny fraction of data and hence not only training but also inference must be carried out collaboratively. (iii) Sharing partially computed models or data across the network raises privacy issues. Therefore, in Edge ML, neural-network model design, training, and inference are entangled with both wireless communication and on-device resource constraints. This project will leverage techniques such as random linear coding, nomographic function representation, and analog joint source-channel coding to develop distributed ML frameworks that are tailored to the desired edge ML tasks, and cognizant of constraints at the edge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Early detection at the MCI stage is a key to delaying onset of this degenerative disease and slow worsening of the symptoms. This project will re-invent a novel, automated, game-based technology that can be used for routine cognitive assessment of older individuals who are at a high risk of developing AD. This technology-enabled method will significantly lower the cost associated with cognitive assessment and enable objective and accurate measurements of one's cognitive status, which will lead to early detection of cognitive declines associated with MCI and AD. This project also brings unique and valuable learning and training opportunities for the diverse students participating in the research and workshop activities.  The proposed applied research will be tightly integrated with the training and mentoring of graduate students to become future leaders in technology innovation and entrepreneurship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will develop a novel technology platform for automated, play-based routine cognitive assessment in older adults and demonstrate its commercial potential. This innovative system employs a set of highly instrumented cubes interfacing with computerized games. The cubes feature programmable visual, auditory, and tactile sensory feedback mechanisms and embedded motion sensors for user performance and behavior assessment via interactive play. The games will be designed to capture working memory, spatial reasoning, response time, and hand-eye coordination skills tailored for the target population. The integrated computational measures of play complexity will enable the system to automatic adjust the game difficulty based on the user performance. The system will not only automate the administration and data collection process, but also produce new types of behavioral data, such as hand tremor, repetitive or hyperactive motions, and manipulation speed. The proposed technology development and evaluation will take the co-design approach in order to effectively address user-specific requirements and technical improvements for potential commercialization.

This project also concerns applications to number theory, with hopes to understand what the geometry of these shapes can tell us about the rational number or integral solutions to these polynomial equations. These problems have applications to other fields of math (e.g. differential geometry) as well as physics (e.g. string theory). <br/><br/>Moduli spaces of higher dimensional algebraic varieties are not as well understood as their curve counterparts. The first overarching question in this project is to the understand compactifications of moduli spaces of higher dimensional algebraic varieties. The approaches taken will be a combination of techniques arising from, e.g. the minimal model program (MMP), as well as K-stability. In particular, the PI plans to understand explicit compactifications in specific cases (e.g. K3 surfaces), and to study how to interpolate between various compactifications in a modular way. The second overarching question, is to investigate how geometry of higher dimensional varieties and their moduli influences arithmetic, studying the rich interplay between algebraic geometry, hyperbolicity, and arithmetic geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Improved projections of future climate rely on more detailed understanding of the mechanisms driving Earth’s climate system, which can often be illuminated from the perspective of geological records of past climates. The research funded by this award will examine the largest global warming event in the recent geological past: the transition from the last ice age to the present interglacial world. First, a climate record will be produced by documenting the age and location of landforms left by rapidly retreating glaciers at the end of the last ice age. These records will then be used, along with computer models, to test hypotheses about different components of the climate system that are thought to play important roles in rapid warming of Earth. Such information will improve understanding of how Earth’s climate system operates and inform models used for climate prediction. This detailed understanding of Earth's climate system may help policy makers to articulate climate policies that will provide multiple societal benefits. The researchers will also educate young scientists in STEM fields, thereby increasing the STEM workforce, which is in the national interest. This award will also will support the education of a science journalism student, who will be trained to communicate the science results to the public, providing long-term benefits of public awareness and understanding of global change science.<br/><br/>Despite significant progress, the origin of ice-age terminations remains unresolved. At the core of this issue is the precise inter- and intra-hemispheric timing of the end of the ice age, because such information yields clues as to the mechanisms that underlie the termination. The research team will test the hypothesis that the temperature rise of the last termination in southern latitudes was earlier and faster than previously recognized, so fast that it may require a major overhaul of existing hypotheses. The research project will use detailed radiocarbon and exposure dating of glacial landforms, along with glaciological modeling, to document the timing and magnitude of the termination of the Cordillera Darwin icefield, in southernmost South America. These data will be integrated with existing paleoclimate records at lower latitudes with the GFDL Earth System Model 2M to assess the feasibility of various forcing factors for the termination, such as an ocean bipolar seesaw, shifting of the southern hemisphere westerlies, and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. This work will strengthen collaborations between US and Chilean institutions and afford mentoring and education opportunities for students.

2000388.xml,Improving Evaluations of STEM Programs: An Empirical Investigation of Key Design Parameters,NSF,2020-06-15,2025-05-31,1328108,"To improve science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) outcomes in K-12 classrooms, it is critical to understand the landscape of the STEM learning environment. However, the STEM learning environment is complex. Students are nested within teachers, and teachers are nested within schools (which in turn are nested within districts), which implies a multilevel structure. To date, most empirical research that uses multilevel modeling to examine the role of higher levels on variation in student outcomes does not examine the teacher level. The reason is that for many states, data linkages between students and teachers have been difficult to achieve. However, in the last five years, this situation has improved in many states, which makes this work now possible. This study seeks to further understanding of the STEM learning environment by 1) examining the extent to which mathematics and science achievement varies across students, teachers, schools, and districts and 2) examining the extent to which student, teacher, school, and district characteristics that are found in state administrative databases can be used to explain this variation at each level. This work will support advances in research and evaluation methodologies that will enable researchers to design more rigorous and comprehensive evaluations of STEM interventions and improve the accuracy of statistical power calculations. Broad dissemination of the resulting tools and techniques will provide access through freely available websites, and workshops and training opportunities to build capacity in the field for STEM researchers to design cluster randomized trials (CRTs) to answer questions beyond what works to for whom and under what conditions. This project is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development. Funding is also provided by the Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12), which supports the research and development of innovative resources, models, and tools in order to enhance STEM learning and teaching by pre-K-12 students and teachers.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to 1) describing and explaining the landscape of the STEM learning environment, an environment which includes students, teachers, and schools, and 2) applying this empirical information in the design of STEM intervention studies to enable researchers to extend beyond the usual questions about if the intervention works and for which types of students or schools. By adding teacher level variables, this analysis would account for key teacher characteristics that may moderate the treatment effect. The research will also increase the efficiency in the design of CRTs of STEM interventions. Specifically, the findings from this study will improve the internal validity and cost-efficiency of evaluations of STEM interventions by increasing the accuracy of estimates for the full range of parameters needed to conduct power analyses, particularly when the teacher level is included. The high cost associated with CRTs makes it critical to plan accurate trials that do not overestimate the required sample size, and hence cost more than necessary, or underestimate the sample size and thereby reduce the potential to generate high-quality evidence of program effectiveness. Including the teacher level in intervention studies, a critical level in the delivery of any intervention, will allow for more testing of teacher characteristics that may moderate intervention effects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how individuals integrate into a new community is an important issue with global implications.  Newcomers, like many others, tend to rely on their social networks to find jobs upon arrival to a new destination, which is crucial to their integration. Finding and holding a job can be important for individual self-worth and well-being, beyond helping to contribute financially to the household. The dynamics of the social networks of newcomers and their labor markets can shed more light on how newcomers adapt to new environments. Findings are relevant to decision making concerning employment for newcomers, with implications for non-newcomers as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research questions are addressed through data collected from a survey and through a vignette experiment.  The survey is administered to current and earlier newcomers in two communities that have experienced population movement.

2002467.xml,Collaborative Research: Reconstructing river discharge and hydrologic variability in Panama via coral geochemistry: Implications for management of the Panama Canal,NSF,2020-06-01,2024-05-31,338346,"Rivers and hydrology play a critical role in tropical ecosystems. They impact aspects of climate, help to sustain life, and influence societal needs such as drinking water, food security, and economics. In Panamá, a specific concern is the impact of rainfall on the functioning of the Panamá Canal. Rainfall and river discharge (Q) are strongly linked in Panamá, and they play a crucial role in the sustained success of the canal. Rainfall totals across Panamá consistently place it in the top five countries for annual rainfall, but when major droughts occur, the Panama Canal Authority places restrictions on ship traffic to conserve water so that the canal can continue to operate. Panamá has a well-known seasonal variability in precipitation, with a wet season that lasts from about May through November. However, little is known about rainfall variation on longer time scales, on the order of decades or centuries. In addition, it is not clear how El Niño events may influence Panamanian rainfall, though there are suggestions of a relationship between El Niño strength and drought severity. These questions are hard to address because instrumental data, particularly river discharge records, are short and often unreliable – we need a longer-term perspective. The chemistry of coral skeletons can preserve records of climate conditions and climate variability; these chemical records are called climate proxies. This project will use coral climate proxies to reconstruct hydrologic variability along the Pacific Coast of Panamá over the past ~300 years at near-monthly resolution. The final product will be a multi-coral, multi-proxy record that can be used to identify the frequency and strength of events such as droughts or El Niño. This project includes support for 8 female undergraduates and 1 Ph.D. student. Results from this project will be incorporated into a teaching workshop for middle and high school educators and will also be shared with water resource managers in Panamá. <br/><br/>Many tropical nations are subjected to intense variation in precipitation with extreme seasonality. Meridional migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is largely responsible for this variability, with northward movement during the boreal summer and a southward shift during the austral summer. In the Pacific, El Niño and other less well constrained decadal and century-scale modes of ocean- atmosphere variability also dictate regional climate. In Panamá, a country whose rainfall and river discharge (Q) are tightly coupled, understanding hydrologic variability is of the utmost importance when considering the potential impacts on the Panamá Canal, whose functioning relies solely on hydraulic head differences between the canal locks and the Gatun Lake reservoir. Therefore, the probability of anomalous hydrologic conditions, such as drought and flooding, must be well defined. However, the lack of long instrumental records of tropical hydrology (i.e.; rainfall and Q) limits our ability to develop a rigorous understanding of drought and flood recurrence intervals. These issues raise the following questions: 1) What is the relationship between El Niño Southern Oscillation and droughts and flooding in Panamá? 2) Can we identify droughts and flood years that are not related to El Niño? And 4) Has there been multi-decadal or long-term secular changes in Q in Panamá and what climatic processes are involved? Preliminary results indicate that barium/calcium (Ba/Ca) time-series data from a coral core collected in 1984 at Secas Island in the Gulf of Chiriquí (GoC) along the Pacific Coast of Panamá has a remarkably strong correlation with Q from two major nearby rivers. Given these encouraging results, we will be completing the Ba/Ca analyses of the Secas Island core back to 1707 CE and to analyze a new GoC coral core collected in 2018. The final near- monthly resolved composite Ba/Ca record of Q will extend from 2018 to 1707 CE. By pairing Ba/Ca and δ18O on the same 1mm samples we can separately evaluate salinity and sea surface temperature changes in the GoC over the last 311 years. These paleo-Q and salinity reconstructions will provide a comprehensive history of Panamanian hydroclimate that can be exploited to track protracted deviations from average conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our movement patterns must be constantly adapted as we grow, age, or experience changing conditions such as slippery sidewalks. Learning new motor skills initiates a process of memory formation that generated improved and more stable performance. Previously learned motor memories can also be used to learn another motor task more rapidly. The goal of this project is to reveal how the human brain creates and recalls memories in walking. This will be achieved by studying a set of tasks inspired by research of arm control. The expected findings will have broad implications for human walking flexibility in health and disease, because motor learning and rehabilitation are thought to share similar mechanisms. The advanced scientific knowledge will have broader impacts, including the possible transformation of gait rehabilitation approaches and enhanced understanding of learning and memory in the human brain. Further, this work includes interdisciplinary neuroscience training of promising students with diverse ethnic, gender, and academic backgrounds.<br/><br/>The research objective of this CAREER proposal is to understand the mechanisms for human locomotor adaptation and learning. While motor learning has received ample attention in studies utilizing upper limbs, there are relatively few studies of motor learning in the context of human locomotion. These experiments will examine the commonalities as well as task-specific distinctions across different types of locomotor learning paradigms: sequence learning, visuomotor adaptation and dynamic (split-belt treadmill) adaptation. Specifically, this work will examine how consolidation leads to offline learning and resistance to interferences between different walking patterns, and the immediate and delayed benefits of variable practice on the generalization of learning. This research will also examine the role of sleep in consolidation and generalization of locomotor learning. The integrated educational plan will provide interdisciplinary neuroscience training to undergraduate and graduate students in order to develop and retain young scientists in the area of movement neuroscience.

2002950.xml,Enzymatic Mechanism of Oxalate Decarboxylase Revealed by Biophysical and Structural Studies,NSF,2020-08-15,2024-07-31,473000,"With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Alexander Angerhofer from the University of Florida to investigate the degradation of oxalic acid by an enzyme known as oxalate decarboxylase which is found in soil bacteria and fungi. Overloading the body with oxalic acid can lead to kidney stones and other adverse health effects in animals and humans. As a plant product oxalic acid is present in many plant-derived foods in appreciable quantities. A way to keep the amount of oxalic acid low is to decompose it by chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes.  The research of Dr. Angerhofer is focused on the elucidation of the mechanism by which the enzyme oxalate decarboxylase breaks down oxalic acid. More specifically, Dr. Angerhofer will test the hypothesis that to decompose oxalic acid, this protein transfers electrons over a long distance, about 2 nm, between two manganese ions, one of which is located at the active site for the chemical transformation of oxalic acid.  This study will involve use of a combination of advanced biochemical methods of protein engineering with structural and spectroscopic methods, including X-ray crystallography, electron paramagnetic resonance, and optical spectroscopy. The results of this research will enhance our fundamental knowledge of reactions that involve bio-active manganese and will ultimately aid in devising strategies to mitigate the presence of oxalic acid in plants. The project supports the training of a growing and diverse science and technology workforce in the state of Florida by involving students in research that helps them acquire scientific and professional skills useful in the bio-economy of the 21st century. The training of undergraduate students is supported through a course-based undergraduate research experience at the University of Florida and through the University Research Scholars Program, which brings gifted freshmen students to the cutting edge of modern research.<br/><br/>This award supports the research of Dr. Angerhofer focused on the study of the molecular mechanisms by which the bacterial enzyme oxalate decarboxylase catalyzes the cleavage of the kinetically inert carbon-carbon bond in oxalic acid. It has been proposed that long-range electron transfer between the manganese ions situated at the N- and the C-terminal ends of the proteins subunits plays an important catalytic role.   X-ray crystallography, molecular dynamics simulations, electrochemistry, and an array of advanced electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technologies, in combination with site-directed mutagenesis will be applied to the problem. The activity of manganese ions in the protein and a chain of electron transfer-active amino acids will be studied. Genetic code expansion methods will be used to introduce unnatural amino acids into the enzyme at specific target sites where they can be used to probe a long-range electron transfer pathway that may exist in the quaternary structure of the enzyme. The planned experiments will yield important structural and kinetic information about substrate and oxygen co-factor binding to the enzyme.  The hypothesis that will be tested is that via long-range electron transfer dioxygen promotes catalysis by generating the +3 oxidation state on the active-site Mn ion situated at the N-terminal end, which in turn drives the reaction. The proposed work will elucidate how proteins tune and utilize the redox potential of mono-nuclear Mn centers for catalysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ESB region is densely populated, with 47% of the U.S. population expected to inhabit the counties adjacent to the shoreline by 2021. Habitat loss, pollution, overfishing, and climate change threaten commercially and ecologically important marine species all along the ESB. This project will make occurrence data with map coordinates available for over 3,000 species of mollusks that find their habitat along the ESB, including mussels, clams, conchs, snails, and squid. Data from these ecologically and commercially important species (over 4.5 million individual specimens) will be made available through public online data portals. While the geographic ranges for many species of mollusks are well-known, the extent of their distribution within the seafloor habitats they occupy is unknown. Adding map coordinates to occurrence records for live-collected mollusks in natural history collections will provide detailed knowledge of distributions. Because natural history collections have specimens collected from the mid-1800s to present, these occurrence records can help track distributional changes over time and lead to better fisheries and conservation management.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One hundred million mollusk specimens have been documented in natural history collections across North America, and the breadth, depth, and growth of these collections is exceptionally well-known compared to other invertebrate taxa. Mollusks are among the best sampled group of animals, with some species having over 2,000 digital records available in natural history collections making them extremely well-suited for environmental and biogeographical studies that track faunal change over time and space. However, already-digitized mollusk lots are missing essential data such as collecting date (30% of records) and reliable georeferences (85% of records). This project will generate reliable geo-coordinate data for all covered specimen lots using a collaborative georeferencing project in GeoLocate.  GeoLocate will add layers for bathymetric data, benthic habitat, and marine conservation areas. Incorporating bathymetry into GeoLocate to determine the extent of locations will also provide that capability for complex elevational data for terrestrial species. Important trait data will also be incorporated. For the first time, molluscan occurrence data will distinguish between live- and dead-collected specimens, with a defined vocabulary for traits added to each record. Due to the long persistence of molluscan shells, the live/dead- collected distinction is crucial for all studies of biotic change using mollusks. Information on collecting dates will be refined where possible to increase resolution for detecting biotic changes. The data will be shared through public data repositories, including iDigBio, GBIF, OBIS, and the InvertEBase Symbiota portal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000493.xml,"Collaborative Research: CHemistry in the Arctic-Clouds, Halogens, and Aerosols (CHACHA)",NSF,2020-09-15,2024-08-31,664051,"This project aims to improve understanding of atmospheric chemistry that impacts ozone, particulate matter, and cloud chemical composition in the context of a rapidly changing Arctic. The atmosphere converts pollutants by processing them into water-soluble products that are removed through precipitation (rain or snow) or by deposition onto Earth’s surface. This chemical conversion of pollution happens through a sunlight-driven (photochemical) process known as oxidation. Most of what is known about these atmospheric processes comes from measurements made at the surface in Arctic coastal environments. The CHACHA team plans to use two instrumented aircraft to conduct airborne measurements around the Chukchi Sea, the Beaufort Sea, and the Alaska North Slope region. They plan to target features that are rapidly changing - above and downwind of sea ice ""leads"" (areas of open water in otherwise sea-ice-covered ocean regions), and downwind of sources of combustion-derived pollutants. Researchers will also use collected data to develop atmospheric models that will be openly available for use by the broader scientific community. The team is composed of researchers at six United States universities (in Alaska, Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and New York) and will mentor a diverse group of students and postdoctoral scholars. Researchers will also engage in several additional education and outreach activities, including an “aircraft open house” and an annual three-day Science Fair in Utqiaġvik, AK. Overall, this project will enable the United States to better understand how rapid change in the Arctic impacts the chemical composition of the atmosphere and to translate what was learned to other regions - including the atmosphere above the world's oceans and in Earth's upper atmosphere. In addition, this project is co-funded by the Arctic Natural Sciences and Atmospheric Chemistry programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will improve understanding of atmospheric halogen chemistry in the gas, aerosol, and cloud water phases, with a focus on how that chemistry is impacted by Arctic sea ice loss and fossil fuel extraction. The CHACHA team plans to conduct eight weeks of observations during the Arctic spring, when halogen chemistry is most active, using two aircraft: the University of Wyoming King Air and the Purdue University Airborne Laboratory for Atmospheric Research (ALAR). Aircraft will conduct complementary sampling upwind and downwind of leads (sea ice fractures), over snow-covered tundra, and downwind of the North Slope of Alaska oilfields. Sampling will occur at various altitudes from the near-surface through the boundary layer and into the free troposphere. The team will prioritize measurement of various greenhouse gases (including O3, CO2, CH4, H2O), reactive trace gases (including NO2, SO2, N2O5, HO2NO2, bromine- and chlorine-containing gases), aerosol size distributions and composition, cloud residual particle composition, and cloud particle size distributions, as well as atmospheric data. These observations will be interpreted in part using 0-D and 1-D photochemical models and a cloud parcel model, to evaluate and advance understanding of multi-phase reactions and the vertical and horizontal propagation of atmospheric halogen chemistry in the Arctic. This dataset will improve understanding of the impact of the rapidly changing Arctic on halogen chemistry and atmospheric composition, as well as to provide fundamental knowledge of halogen chemistry that can be applied globally through models. The team will mentor students, postdocs, and conduct an array of unique outreach and educational activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002485.xml,Collaborative Research: How Robust Are Common-Era Sea-Level Reconstructions?,NSF,2020-06-01,2025-05-31,283899,"Sea-level rise is one of the most challenging aspects of climate change.  In order to be confident in predictions of future sea level estimates, it is important to clearly understand how and why sea level changed naturally in the past. This project will collect field data and perform computer modeling to improve our understanding of the main factors that control average sea level during the Common Era (past ~2,000 years). For example, changes in wind and ocean currents, water temperature, and the rebound of land surfaces caused by removing the weight of ice or sediments all contribute to changes in the record of sea level at any location.  This project will examine the origin and nature of uncertainties that enter into sea level reconstructions based on errors in estimating each of these factors in the past. The project will not only help scientists improve our understanding of the causes of sea level changes, but it also will help coastal planners by providing better models for projecting sea-level changes into the future. The project will also support three young scientists, deepening their field, laboratory, and modeling skills.<br/><br/>Understanding sea level during the Common Era is central to establishing the uniqueness of modern sea-level rise related to anthropogenic climate change, identifying links between sea level and natural climate variability, and training semi-empirical models of future sea-level rise. Past studies estimate global-mean sea level during the Common Era using proxy records. These estimates differ substantially in terms of global-mean sea-level variability during pre-industrial times. It remains to establish how sensitive these estimates are to various uncertainties, assumptions, and choices involved in producing global-mean sea-level time series from the raw data. A detailed study of the robustness and reproducibility of Common-Era sea-level reconstructions based on field, laboratory, and modeling analyses is proposed. Objectives include: (1) determine the reproducibility of high-resolution salt-marsh sea-level reconstructions; and (2) quantify the robustness of model estimates of Common-Era global-mean sea level. Outcomes will fill basic knowledge gaps, advancing understanding of the Common Era, and leading to better characterization of trends, patterns, and causes of pre- and post-industrial sea-level change. By documenting past spatiotemporal variability of sea level, evaluating associated rates of change during the Common Era, and identifying links to ocean circulation and climate, the project will contribute to achieving the goals and scientific objectives of the Paleo Perspectives on Climate Change (P2C2) program. Efforts will make progress towards the broader goals of sea-level research related to the sensitivity of ice sheets to climate change, the response of the solid Earth to redistribution of ice mass, and the assimilation of proxy records and instrumental observations within a coherent probabilistic framework.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This will be accomplished by assimilating high-resolution paleo-proxies from corals and trees into a dynamical El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) model.<br/><br/>Dynamically informed paleo-reconstructions will be studied to address the following science questions: (i) how does the tropical Pacific respond to external radiative forcing (ERF); (ii) does ENSO exhibit regime-like behavior and is ENSO irregularity primarily due to chaotic or to noise-driven dynamics; (iii) how has ENSO varied in the past; and (iv) can a dynamical ENSO model improve paleo-proxy reconstructions of the tropical Pacific. <br/><br/>These questions have implications for predictability and decadal variability and are relevant to understanding ENSO and its impacts, past, present and future. Adding information into paleoclimate reconstructions from a dynamical model of ENSO with documented predictive skill is a novel approach and may enhance interpretation of Tropical Pacific proxy records. <br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts include improved understanding of ENSO behavior over time, support of undergraduate students in the research project, and outreach to the public through well-established outreach efforts at Columbia University and the University of Maryland.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002850.xml,New Paradigms of Quantum Criticality,NSF,2020-09-01,2023-08-31,450000,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research aimed at describing the connection between physical properties of modern quantum materials and the nature of many-particle quantum entanglement. Conventional theories of electron motion in metals and semiconductors usually treat the motion of each electron independently, in an average environment defined by the other electrons. This independent electron picture has been quite successful in many metals and semiconductors. However, in many newly discovered materials, some of significant technological importance, the subtle quantum correlations between the electrons need to be accounted for, even for an understanding of their macroscopic properties. In particular, quantum entanglement leading to “spooky action at a distance” can be present not only between a pair of electrons, but across long distances and involving large numbers of electrons. A class of materials of particular interest in this research are the cuprate high temperature superconductors, all of which are layered materials containing layers with copper and oxygen atoms arranged in a square lattice. There is accumulating experimental evidence for a ""quantum critical point"" near a mobile electron density where the highest critical temperature for superconductivity is observed. This theoretical research will describe the phase transition in the electron entanglement across this critical point. New methods for describing many particle entanglement have been developed by the PI and others, and also across different fields of physics, including quantum information theory, high energy particle theory, and quantum gravity. These advances will be synthesized in new theoretical frameworks, and subjected to tests by observations on quantum materials.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will also contribute to the development of the scientific workforce by supporting the training of graduate students and postdoctoral associates in topics at the forefront of theoretical condensed matter physics. Furthermore, the PI will continue to pursue an active program of public lectures, interviews, colloquia, and lectures at schools for advanced graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research which will examine models of quantum criticality involving gauge theories coupled to finite density matter. While much is known about phase transitions of gauge theories coupled to relativistic matter in 2+1 spacetime dimensions, applications to cuprate criticality require finite density fermionic matter which, in the absence of disorder, has a sharp Fermi surface. The PI and his research team have proposed specific gauge theories for cuprate criticality which satisfy numerous phenomenological constraints imposed by observations. In some mathematical contexts, the combination of the gauge structure and the presence of a Fermi surface leads to effective quantum field theories which are bilocal in time. Currently, little is understood about such bilocal theories in 2+1 dimensions, and unraveling this mystery will be an important focus of this research. Previously, bilocal theories have appeared in models with infinite-range interactions, like the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models, which have some attractive phenomenological features. Insights gained from the study of SYK models will be applied to the more realistic bilocal field theories appearing in this research. Another focus area of the research will be on the thermal Hall effect: In the most recent experiments, the thermal Hall effect has emerged as a powerful diagnostic probe of quantum phase transitions associated with changes in entanglement structure. The PI and his team will extend theories of the thermal Hall effect to models of the pseudogap phase of the cuprates. In addition, correlated electron superconductivity in twisted graphene bilayers will be studied, with a focus on the quantum interplay of multiple competing orders and superconductivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will also contribute to the development of the scientific workforce by supporting the training of graduate students and postdoctoral associates in topics at the forefront of theoretical condensed matter physics.

The project will study how an inclusive educational and workplace climate can affect academic STEM career outcomes, particularly for early-career individuals from underrepresented groups.  The proposers will develop a novel construct of inclusive authorship climate in which intellectual contributions are fully welcomed and valued throughout the research process. The proposers will examine inclusive climate at the levels of the research group, department, and profession, each of which likely shapes career outcomes for underrepresented, early-career STEM scholars.  Ultimately, this project will advance understanding of how to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM.<br/><br/>The study builds on the organizational theory of Person-Environment Fit (PE Fit) which claims that career outcomes and attitudes are positively affected by having an organizational environment that is congruent with an individual’s needs, skills, and values.  The proposers argue that for individuals in STEM from underrepresented groups, 'fit' requires an inclusive climate (i.e., an environment that values differences and makes all feel welcome). The researchers will develop, test and implement a survey of 3,500 graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and assistant professors in four STEM fields for which faculty racial minority representation is low and gender representation is low or moderate: physics, economics, biology, and psychology. Structural equation modeling will quantify differences in the effect of inclusive climate on career outcomes of scholars at three different career stages, in departments with different institutional prestige, and in disciplines with different norms and cultures.

These features can be employed to build structures with customized properties and functionalities- previously thought to be unattainable. The applications of such developments range from on-chip communication systems, to high power semiconductor lasers, to sensing. This research will result in a better understanding of how amplification and attenuation can be independently manipulated and harnessed in both optically and electrically pumped arrangement and will shed light on the role and the fundamentals of exceptional points in optics. In addition, the proposed work provides a bridge between mathematics, quantum physics, and engineering while promoting the concept of exceptional points in optics. These ideas could lead to new design tools that can be deployed to address some of the long-standing problems in laser physics. If successful, this effort could potentially transform chip-scale integrated photonics and high power semiconductor laser technologies. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the proposed activity, the students engaged in this project will have the opportunity to prepare for a broad range of future careers by experiencing all the steps involved in a scientific endeavor, starting from conceiving an idea that perhaps originates from mathematics, to experimentally demonstrating the anticipated behavior, and finally building a prototype device. By means of presentations, publications, and classroom/laboratory teaching, the knowledge acquired during the course of this project will be disseminated to a broader audience. This program will provide research opportunities not only to graduate, but also to undergraduate, and K-12 students. Finally, students from minority and under-represented groups will be proactively integrated into the research environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Description: &lt;br/&gt;The proposed effort will make use of the physics and peculiarities of non-Hermitian exceptional points (EPs) in order to develop alternative strategies in designing novel photonic devices that complement and/or improve existing integrated photonic circuits. In a photonic system, exceptional points can be advantageously introduced through a judicious interplay between refractive index shaping and gain-loss contrast. Along these lines, two endeavors associated with chip-scale photonic components and networks will be pursued: (i) demonstrating a new class of single mode integrated lasers with increased brightness and/or spectral purity, (ii) enhancing the sensing characteristics of active photonic molecules by exploiting the inherent features of higher-order exceptional points. The prospect of using InP technologies as a versatile platform to explore the physics and applications of exceptional points in optics will also be investigated."

The goal of this technology is to address swallowing and speech related problems, such as Dysphagia (i.e., swallowing problems).  The occurrence of Dysphagia is as high as 22% in people over 50 years of age and as many as 30% of them receive inpatient medical treatment. In addition, 8-9% of young children have a speech disorder and about 50% of the US children (3-17 years of age) receive intervention services for a voice, speech, language, or swallowing disorder. Further, the swallowing and speech problems result from other illnesses such as stroke, spinal cord injury, head neck cancer, and Parkinson’s disease.  The proposed device will be powered through a wireless system connected to a battery worn in a necklace-like non-invasive device. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of a wearable intraoral neuromodulation system to solve problems with intraoral sensorimotor loop operation that cause swallowing and speech disorders. By monitoring and stimulating the intraoral organs, this technology will provide high spatiotemporal resolution to favorably intervene in intraoral sensorimotor loop operations. For example, the technology is designed to monitor the beginning of the pharyngeal phase of swallowing and modulate the activity of pharyngeal muscles for swallowing by stimulating the soft palatal nerves. In another example, the technology will monitor the tongue movement during speech and modulate the movement or posture of the tongue by applying stimulation at specific times and specific locations of the tongue. This device also has a unique feature using real-time wireless power transfer between the intraoral coil and necklace coil, which can be easily maintained. The necklace electronics have a battery capacity that is able to power the intraoral electronics for a full day. This real-time power transfer may significantly reduce (or eliminate) the size of the battery for the intraoral device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A fundamental social and biological fact about human beings is that where people live shapes who they become, and their health and economic prospects in particular. The reasons for this are still not fully understood but one key reason is that people do not live on their own; relationships to others give rise to face-to-face social networks, and these social connections generally occupy the same places. Research has established the connections between networks and place, and between networks and health, but this doctoral dissertation research project explores the intersection of all three (people in networks in places).  Results may help practitioners and decision makers create new ways of thinking about geographically contextualized networks and new ways of addressing important public health concerns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research uses extremely detailed data on 24,812 individuals in 176 communities in a setting in which people live in close proximity to members of their social networks.  Statistical methods such as multilevel models are employed to answer a variety of questions related to networks, geography, and health. The researcher investigates the following questions: 1) Is network centrality associated with geographic centrality and how do these locations impact health? 2) Are negative ties between individuals spatially patterned such that individuals “keep their enemies closer” than their friends, and how does this proximity influence health? 3) Using the ecological concept of “ecotones,” do individuals in particular locations experience higher variability in health outcomes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hartland and his group at the University of Notre Dame to create ultra-small, nanometer-sized mass balances that can operate at room temperature. All objects vibrate and the vibration frequencies depend on the size and shape of the object. These vibration frequencies are very high for nanoparticles and they change when two particles are attached to each other. Using this effect, this project contributes to sensing particles whose sizes make them very difficult to detect with conventional techniques. By accurately measuring mass, the researchers are able to identify unknown particles such as viruses. The fundamental knowledge gained from this study can also enable the detection of a variety of chemicals and particles in the environment. The accurate detection of chemicals and particles is important for assessing potential risks from environmental and biological hazards. This research provides training and education to graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Notre Dame as well as from local primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs). This project also provides research experience for high school students and teachers from Elkhart Community Schools. <br/><br/>The vibrational modes of metal nanostructures suspended in air or placed on low density substrates have very high quality factors which allows their frequencies to be accurately measured. With this award from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program, Professor Hartland and his group at the University of Notre Dame use suspended nanostructures to study how the vibrational modes of the nanostructures are affected by adsorbed mass. They also examine the coupling between the vibrational modes of different nanostructures, and coherently control the vibrational motion of coupled nanostructures. These experiments are performed by transient absorption microscopy implemented with asynchronous optical sampling, a dual laser technique that avoids the use of a mechanical delay line to record data. The results of the measurements allow the masses of large uncharged particles to be directly determined, which is a challenge for conventional mass spectrometers. In addition, ultrafast mid-infrared pump transient absorption microscopy is used to image the plasmon resonances of single metal nanostructures. These experiments generate new information about the form of the plasmon modes of these structures, which is important for understanding the field enhancements that are central to surface enhanced spectroscopies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Responding to these changes in the labor market since the 1970s, a growing number of American families pursued money outside of labor markets. In this project, three case studies will follow the rise of direct selling (Avon, Amway, Herbalife), leasing of accessory dwelling units within homes, and the rise of home equity extraction. Direct sellers in the 1980s and 1990s carefully balanced attempts to marketize kinship and social ties, without severing them irreparably, that provided housewives an avenue to pursue secondary incomes without fully abandoning the ideal of the breadwinner-homemaker model. Families who began leasing spare bedrooms and garages in the 1990s sought to avoid the stigma of immigrant informality by leasing “granny flats” and “in-law units,” portraying their marketization of the single-family home as a natural extension of the nuclear family. Extractions of home-equity in the early 2000s tapped into long-time associations between property ownership and landed independence, allowing homeowners to interpret equity loans as tapping into their wealth, rather than as taking on risky loans. These cases illustrate household strategies to generate resources outside standard wages—providing a lens into a rearrangement of household economic life since the 1970s. Findings will inform governmental policies, particularly those governing dwelling leasing and home equity extraction, to maximize their appropriate use balanced against risk.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As American households faced uncertain returns to waged labor, its members grew likely to embrace three strategies of industriousness: (1) labor-intensive industriousness characterized by increases in the number of wage earners or the time devoted to wage work by a household; (2) distributive industriousness, characterized by entrepreneurial turns toward kinship and social networks in attempts to siphon small but regular access to cash resources; and (3) rentier industriousness, characterized by attempts at securing incomes from claims on household goods or assets. Because most social research on labor restructuring focuses on labor-intensive industriousness, the core of this project are case studies of the distributive and rentier household activity.  Leveraging administrative and archival data from municipalities, federal regulators, congressional records, newspapers, and industry publications, each of the three case studies analyzes: (1) the motivations driving early industrious activity; (2) regulatory challenges and incorporation; and (3) trajectories of socio-economic, racial, and gendered diffusion across groups of households. This project suggests that at the root of recent expansions in economic informality are not new technology platforms, but rather changes in labor market organization dating back to the 1980s. The findings of this research illuminate sociological theories regarding the family and its intersection with the U.S. economy in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Findings will also provide insight into related changes as work continues to evolve in the United States and the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During this process, lithium (Li) contained in silicate rocks is released and eventually delivered into the ocean by rivers. Intensity of weathering is known to influence the amount and isotopic composition (δ7Li) of Li delivered into the ocean. Thus, changes in the concentration of Li in seawater and its δ7Li can provide valuable information on the history and evolution of silicate weathering and its roles in regulating global carbon cycle and the Earth’s climate. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) minerals produced by certain groups of marine organisms are known to incorporate trace amounts of Li from seawater, and thus they can be used as a recorder for those changes. However, our current understanding on how Li is incorporated into CaCO3 and what controls the process is extremely limited. In this study, researchers from the University of Hawaii (UH) will perform a series of laboratory experiments to better understand the mechanism of Li incorporation into CaCO3. This work will pave the road for further development in the use of marine CaCO3 minerals as the tracer for past changes in seawater Li and hence continental silicate weathering.

Changes in seawater Li concentration and δ7Li can provide valuable information on the history and evolution of silicate weathering and its roles in regulating global carbon cycle and the Earth’s climate. CaCO3 minerals that incorporate Li can be used as a recorder for those changes. This study will be based on well-established inorganic CaCO3 precipitation experiments, where an array of solution physicochemical parameters will be systematically varied from the same control condition for straightforward comparisons of their impacts on δ7Li and Li concentrations in CaCO3. Furthermore, with the use of seeds, both calcite and aragonite samples will be synthesized under identical experimental conditions to examine the polymorphic controls on Li incorporation. This project is expected to provide by far the most complete experimental datasets, which will be combined with the use of surface kinetic modelling to establish a firm inorganic (kinetic and equilibrium) baseline for the elemental and isotopic partitioning of Li between solution and CaCO3 minerals. The project enhances education and career development in the geosciences for graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Hawaii, where the student population has diverse and often underrepresented ethnic background.

2001076.xml,Biomimetic Redox Chemistry for Antiviral Application,NSF,2020-07-15,2024-06-30,302958,"PART 1:   NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/> <br/>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be used to disinfect a wide range of pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi. ROS is an attractive disinfectant as it decomposes into non-toxic degradation products (water and oxygen). However, ROS is highly reactive and can be hazardous to store and transport. This project aims at utilizing a unique chemistry found in mussel adhesive proteins to create a portable biomaterial that can be activated to generate ROS. The antiviral capability of the generated ROS will be tested against different viruses with varying properties and levels of chemical resistance. The biomaterial itself does not contain ROS and is only activated to generate ROS by a simple hydration process. The proposed biomimetic material can potentially be used as a portable, light-weight disinfectant for preventing viral infection. The proposed research will engage undergraduate and graduate students, as well as underrepresented community college students, in interdisciplinary research involving polymeric materials, biomimetic chemistry, and antiviral research. Additionally, investigators will develop a new polymeric biomaterials module as part of the Michigan Technology University Summer Youth Program to introduce high school students in hands-on activities related to the use of biomaterials as a drug carrier. <br/><br/><br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The proposed work aims at harvesting the byproduct of a unique reduction-oxidation chemistry found in mussel adhesive proteins for antiviral application. Polymers are functionalized with the adhesive molecule, catechol, which generate hydrogen peroxide during autoxidation. To enhance the antiviral capability of catechol-containing materials, polymer architecture and composition, as well as the reactivity of catechol will be tuned to create polymer systems that are optimized to generate potent radical-based ROS, such as superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical. The ability for the generated ROS to inactivate both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses as well as a herpes virus will be explored. Results from this proposal will provide a greater understanding on the dose, duration, and type of ROS needed to inactivate different types of viruses with varying properties and levels of biocide resistance. ROS is generated on-demand when the material is hydrated in an aqueous solution with neutral pH. This process involves the conversion of molecular oxygen in the solution to ROS, through the oxidation of the catechol moiety. This approach is drastically different from other existing approaches that contain ROS, require externally provided chemical reactants, or require external energy sources to generate ROS. The material does not contain a reservoir for storing the reactive ROS, which greatly simplifies how it could be stored and transported.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002543.xml,Collaborative Research: Rapid Climate Change During the Miocene Climate Optimum: A Proxy-Model Comparison,NSF,2020-08-01,2024-07-31,165040,"The Miocene Climatic Optimum, between 18 and 13 million years ago, is one of Earth's most recent prolonged warming events with peak global surface temperature about 7 degrees Celsius (13 degrees Fahrenheit) above present and characterized by intervals of abrupt variability. Despite this warmer surface temperature, carbon dioxide concentrations were similar to forecasts of the coming decades while the configuration of continents on the global was quite similar to present-day. Therefore, this period of warmer climate may provide a useful benchmark to understand future climate change. The scientific results of this research will help clarify the impacts of warming on the South American Monsoon System may have on millions of people that presently depend on it for water resources. Through a series of large public lectures, this project will also increase awareness about the power of climate models for informing on future climate and environmental change. Furthermore, the project will provide content for undergraduate- and graduate-level courses and help grow the nascent Department of Geosciences at the University of Connecticut (UConn). With the potential impacts of this new data and the associated educational components, this project stands to significantly benefit society.<br/><br/>Although understanding of the climate of this Miocene Climatic Optimum (MCO) is well documented through a variety of proxy records, the continental record remains poorly resolved. This data gap hinders our ability to distinguish the temperature responses between land and sea, and thus, limits our ability to use the MCO as an analog for future climate change. This project will therefore analyze the record of paleoclimate from the Central Andes preserved in the geochemistry, palynology, physical sedimentology and paleontology of ancient sand seas and paleo river and lake deposits at key localities in NW Argentina. The research team will combine this effort with a series of Miocene sensitivity experiments with the Community Earth System Model to test if CO2 driven warming is able to produce the geochemical and paleoenvironmental data or if other mechanisms, such as Antarctic ice volume and orbital changes, are required. This multidisciplinary research will provide insights into the causes and responses of rapid climate changes under climate warming.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the Retention of Latinx in Engineering Jobs,NSF,2020-08-15,2025-07-31,808418,"Slow progress has been made over the past several years to broaden the involvement of groups who are underrepresented in engineering disciplines. The number of Latinxs in particular continues to decrease at each transition point along the pathway to becoming a practicing engineer (i.e., declaring a engineering major, graduating with an engineering degree, working in the engineering field). Increased efforts across the engineering ecosystem, but specifically during the college-to-work transition, are needed to broaden the participation of Latinxs (one of the fastest growing ethnic groups in the U.S.) and to meet the industry demands to fill engineering jobs, which are projected to increase in the next decade. This project aims to understand environmental, personal, and psychological factors that influence work engagement, satisfaction, and persistence decisions during the college-to-work transition among Latinx in engineering, as well as during the early years of their career. The investigators will conduct annual surveys, experiential surveys, and individual interviews about workplace experiences with Latinx in the engineering workforce across a 5-year period to track factors related to Latinx engineers’ work engagement, job satisfaction, and persistence in the field. This project is a joint effort between the University of Missouri and the University of North Dakota and is supported by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development. Additional support has been provided by the Directorate for Engineering's Broadening Participation in Engineering (BPE) program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As posited by the integrative social cognitive career theory lens, the investigators hypothesize that the relations among social cognitive, contextual and cultural factors will explain a significant amount of variance in Latinx engineers’ work engagement, satisfaction, and persistence. Structural equation modeling (SEM) will be used to examine this hypothesis longitudinally. The investigators will assess the integrative SCCT model’s generalizability based on gender, race, and the interaction of gender and race via SEM multigroup analyses.  The investigators also will use experience sampling methodology to gather fine-grained snapshots of perceived workplace climate to examine the effects of momentary and longitudinal changes in such perceptions on Latinx engineers’ work engagement, satisfaction, and persistence via multilevel modeling and growth modeling. Finally, they will generate a reliable and valid measure of engineering interests for employed engineers using factor analytical and Item Response Theory techniques. Potential outcomes of the project include: 1) examining the utility of the integrative SCCT model in predicting engagement, satisfaction, and persistence in engineering for Latinxs in engineering during the college-to-work transition and early career stages; 2) a new measure of engineering interests for use in future research; and 3) the development of custom interventions to augment relevant systemic supports, minimize systemic barriers, and bolster social cognitions that are strong predictors of work engagement, satisfaction, and persistence for Latina women and Latino men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The LepNet TCN unlocks data from North American Lepidoptera holdings across the US that provides a baseline to track changes in species and communities, and to correlate them with climate and other human-related changes in the environment.  This PEN will complement the Lepnet TCN by adding underrepresented historic New England moths and butterflies including species from the unique pitch pine / scrub oak ecosystems. The project will increase the number of currently digitized New England species in LepNet by 63 percent and the number of digitized specimens by 40 percent. Data from this project will be made available on the LepNet portal for the research community, government agencies, students, educators, and the general public.

2000992.xml,COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: Orbital-scale Variability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and the Formation of Bottom Water in the Ross Sea during the Pliocene-Pleistocene,NSF,2020-09-01,2024-08-31,203475,"Part I: Non-technical description: &lt;br/&gt;Predicting how polar ice sheets will respond to future global warming is difficult because all the processes that contribute to their melting are not well understood. This is important because the more ice on land that melts, the higher sea levels will rise. The most significant uncertainty in current estimates of sea-level rise in the coming decades is the potential contribution from the Antarctic Ice Sheet. One way to increase our knowledge about how large ice sheets respond to climate change in response to natural factors is to examine the geologic past. Natural global warming (and cooling) events in Earth’s history provide examples that we can use to better understand processes, interactions, and responses we can’t directly observe today. One such time period, approximately three million years ago (known as the Pliocene), was the last time atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were as high as they are today and, therefore, represents a time period to study to better understand the ice sheet response to a warming climate. Specifically, this project is interested in understanding how ocean currents near Antarctica, which transport heat and store carbon, behaved during these past climate events. The history of past ice sheet-ocean interactions are recorded in sediments that were deposited, layer upon layer, in the deep sea offshore Antarctica. In January-February 2018, a team of scientists and crew set sail to the Ross Sea, offshore west Antarctica, on the scientific ocean drilling vessel JOIDES Resolution to recover such sediment archives. This project focuses on a sediment core from that expedition, which captures the relatively warm Pliocene time interval, as well as the subsequent transition into cooler climates typical of the past two million years. The researchers will analyze the sediment with multiple complementary measurements, including: grain size, composition, chemistry of organic matter, physical structures, microfossil type and abundance, and more. These analyses will be done by the research team, including several students, at their respective laboratories and will then integrated into a unified record of ice sheet-ocean interactions. Ultimately, the results will be used to improve modeled projections of how the Antarctic Ice Sheet could respond to future climate change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part II: Technical description: &lt;br/&gt;Geological records from the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) margin demonstrate that the ice sheet oscillated in response to orbital variations in insolation (i.e., ~400, 100, 41, and 20 kyr), and it appears to be more sensitive to specific frequencies that regulate mean annual insolation (i.e., 41-kyr obliquity), particularly when the ice sheet extends into marine environments and is impacted by ocean circulation. However, the relationship between orbital forcing and the production of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) is unconstrained. Thus, a knowledge gap exists in understanding how changing insolation impacts ice marginal and Southern Ocean conditions that directly influence ventilation of the global ocean. The researchers hypothesize that insolation-driven changes directly affected the production and export of AABW to the Southern Ocean from the Pliocene through the Pleistocene. For example, obliquity amplification during the warmer Pliocene may have led to enhanced production and export of dense waters from the shelf due to reduced AIS extent, which, in turn, led to greater AABW outflow. To determine the relationship of AABW production to orbital regime, they plan to reconstruct both from a single, continuous record from the levee of Hillary Canyon, a major conduit of AABW outflow, on the Ross Sea continental rise. To test their hypothesis, they will analyze sediment from IODP Site U1524 (recovered in 2018 during International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 374) and focus on three data sets. (1) They will use the occurrence, frequency, and character of mm-scale turbidite beds as a proxy of dense-shelf-water cascading outflow and AABW production. They will estimate the down-slope flux via numerical modeling of turbidity current properties using morphology, grain size, and bed thickness as input parameters. (2) They will use grain-size data, physical properties, XRF core scanning, CT imaging, and hyperspectral imaging to guide lithofacies analysis to infer processes occurring during glacial, deglacial, and interglacial periods. Statistical techniques and optimization methods will be applied to test for astronomical forcing of sedimentary packages in order to provide a cyclostratigraphic framework and interpret the orbital-forcing regime. (3) They will use bulk sedimentary carbon and nitrogen abundance and isotope data to determine how relative contributions of terrigenous and marine organic matter change in response to orbital forcing. All of these data will be integrated with sedimentological records to deconvolve organic matter production from its deposition or remobilization due to AABW outflow as a function of the oscillating extent of the AIS. These data sets will be integrated into a unified chronostratigraphy to determine the relationship between AABW outflow and orbital-forcing scenarios under the varying climate regimes of the Plio-Pleistocene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002470.xml,Collaborative Research: A North Pacific ice core record of summer climate and wildfire history during the last 1500 years,NSF,2020-09-01,2025-08-31,137419,"This project intends to use the Mount Denali ice core archive to develop the most comprehensive suite of North Pacific fire and summer climate proxy records since about 2500 years before present. Wildfire is a key component of summer climate in the North Pacific where wildfires are projected to increase with continued summer warming. Studies that combine paleorecords of summer climate and wildfire are therefore critically needed, especially in the North Pacific region where fire recurrence rate and decadal-to-centennial scale climate fluctuations occur over longer time periods than are covered by direct observations. The goal of the proposed research is to improve our understanding of relationships between summertime climate and wildfire activity, focusing especially on the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), when regional temperatures were perhaps as warm as the 20th century. Recent advances now permit the measurement of new fire-related (pyrogenic) compounds in ice cores, enabling the development of a robust fire record capable of rigorous comparison with regional paleoclimate reconstructions. <br/><br/>The records of summer atmospheric circulation developed through this project will be regionally unique and fill a critical gap in the suite of North Pacific paleoclimate records. The ice core fire records will have synchronously dated temperature, precipitation and circulation time series. Our unique compilation of these ice core records, as well as other regional paleoproxy records will be the first effort at combining these datasets into a regional compilation of paleofire records in the North Pacific region. This compilation will facilitate the examination of fire activity during Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) conditions that are of comparable magnitude to present climate changes over socially relevant timescales (decades). We will analyze the archive Denali ice core for black carbon, which is derived from both biomass and fossil fuel combustion, and organic aromatic acids (e.g. vanillic acid) and monosaccharide anhydride (e.g. levoglucosan) which are produced solely from biomass burning. The Denali ice core chronology is already developed, and the archive ice is in hand, ensuring that our research plan can be accomplished. Fire record synthesis and calibration will incorporate instrumental fire databases, gridded burn area data, and HYSPLIT back-trajectory analyses over the instrumental era in order to test the sensitivity of fireclimate relationships over time. With this record we will address the following research questions: (1) How have North Pacific summer atmospheric circulation patterns varied over the last 1500 years? (2) How did North Pacific fire regime characteristics naturally respond to the warm summer conditions of the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA)? (3) Are there consistent relationships between North Pacific fire regime and climate?<br/><br/>A focal point of our broader impacts is support for two young investigators who have specialized expertise in North Pacific ice cores and paleofire modeling, respectively. This project will also support one PhD student and several undergraduate students. We will continue our longstanding collaboration with Denali National Park to present and permanently display our major climate- and fire-related findings at the park visitor center in Talkeetna, Alaska. We are partnering with the Natural Sciences Education and Outreach Center at Colorado State University to develop STEM kits focused on the Denali ice core record for distribution to under-served K-12 students in Alaska and Maine. Prototypes of these kits have already been developed and tested with students, and we propose to significantly expand this program and increase its impact. Other activities include the participation of first-year women researchers in this project as part of the Dartmouth Women In Science Project (WISP) initiative, and through participation in the NSF-supported School of Ice, where faculty from historically black colleges and minority-serving institutions learn about ice cores and climate change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002936.xml,Collaborative Research: Optical Transitions in Metallic Nanoclusters at High Pressure,NSF,2020-07-01,2025-06-30,375000,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This research program contributes to innovations in nanomaterials that are useful in biomedical therapies, sensing, and catalysis. Nanoclusters that consist of fewer than ~200 metallic atoms are of interest due to their luminescence in near-infrared light, bio-compatibility and ultra-small size. The relationship between the structure and optical properties of these nanoclusters remains unclear, which prevents the design of nanoclusters with optimized performance. This program uses pressure to modify the structure of nanoclusters, in order to learn about the electronic transitions that are responsible for light absorption and luminescence, as well as the stability of nanoclusters under external stimulus. This research is closely tied to our educational plans through the training of postdocs and graduate students, by supporting underrepresented groups at the K-12 and college level in science and technology, and by supporting science teachers in the community. In addition, modules that explain the influence of mechanics on optical behavior will be incorporated into undergraduate courses during this program.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>The proposed research is concerned with characterizing the properties of atomically precise clusters composed of gold or silver plus ligands using diamond anvil cell techniques to apply high pressure, and with optical measurements (both absorption and emission) to study excited states.  The experiments will be modeled using electronic structure theory, including ground state calculations to determine structures, and excited state studies to determine optical properties, and including methods development based on second linear response theory and domain-separated density functional theory.  The research is aimed at identifying optical properties such as plasmon to exciton transitions, and an increase in luminescence efficiency with increasing pressure; both properties are of interest to using the clusters in practical applications.  The research includes three research objectives: (1) study of energy transfer responsible for broad absorption & near-infrared luminescence of the cluster material under pressure, (2) determine the source of anomalous multiple emissions of the nanoclusters, and (3) studies of 2-3 nm nanoclusters to characterize the transition from plasmonic to excitonic states.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The data includes anonymized student performance data (grades and standardized test results) and anonymized existing audio recordings of classroom discussions between students and teachers. The audio data will be used to analyze the student-teacher discussions for effectiveness of the student-teacher discussions in student learning. As the effectiveness measures are developed, feedback for instructional improvement will be provided to the teachers in a design cycle for continuous improvement. The technological innovations are in the analysis of the student-teacher discussions, in natural language understanding of student-teacher discussions, and in machine learning to classify effective from non-effective student-teacher discussions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance cyber-enabled, teacher analytics as a new genre of technology that provides automated feedback on teacher performance with the goal of improving teaching effectiveness and student achievement. The exemplary implementation will autonomously analyze audio from real-world English and language arts classes for indicators of effective discourse to enable a new paradigm of datadriven reflective practice. The project emphasizes six theoretical dimensions of discourse linked to student achievement growth: goal clarity, disciplinary concepts, and strategy use for teacher-led discourse, and challenge, connection, and elaborated feedback for transactional discourse. The innovation aims to help teachers develop expertise on these dimensions and will be developed and tested in 9th grade classrooms in Western Pennsylvania. The team will first generate initial insights on how teacher discourse predicts student achievement via a re-analysis of large volumes (128 hours) of existing classroom audio. Next, they will design and iteratively refine hardware/software interfaces for efficient,flexible, scalable audio data collection by teachers. The data will be used to computationally model dimensions of effective discourse by combining linguistic, discursive, acoustic, and contextual analysis ofaudio with supervised and semi-supervised deep recurrent neural networks. The model-based estimates will be incorporated into an interactive analytic/visualization platform to promote data-driven reflective practice. After refinement via design studies, the impact of the innovation on instructional improvement and student literacy outcomes will be evaluated in a randomized control trial. Finally, generalizable insights will be identified at every stage of the project to promote transferability to future cyber-enabled,teacher-analytics technologies."

2000205.xml,Coulomb Gases and Vortex Systems: Two-Dimensional Physics and Beyond,NSF,2020-06-01,2023-05-31,339156,"The Coulomb electrostatic interaction is one of the fundamental forces in nature, governing how elementary charged particles interact. For example, stars are essentially plasmas - that is gases of positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons attracting and repelling one another according to the Coulomb force. The formation of crystals, which are periodic arrangements of atoms, can be roughly explained via repulsive electrostatic (Coulomb) forces coupled with a binding force. In Physics, a ""two-component plasma"" is a large collection of positively charged particles and as many negatively charged particles; a ""one-component plasma"" is a large collection of positively charged particles with the negative particles replaced by a uniform neutralizing background. Such systems are also called ""Coulomb gases,"" and they are quite important in theoretical physics. Physicists predicted that in two-dimensional Coulomb gases, a new intermediate state of matter - formed of dipoles of oppositely charged particles - should exist between the totally ordered (solid) and disordered (liquid) state, once a certain critical temperature is reached. This was a new type of phase transition in statistical physics. It is specific to dimension 2 and an important example of two-dimensional physics. This project is particularly concerned with the analysis of large Coulomb gases in dimension 2 and higher, both one-component and two-component, in the framework of statistical mechanics (that is, with temperature), and using the techniques of mathematical analysis and probability theory. Also motivating such questions are the study of energy levels of large atoms (spectrum of large random matrices), vortices in superconductors and Bose-Einstein condensates, the fractional quantum Hall effect, and more loosely questions in biology or hydrodynamics. The project also contains a component on the mathematical analysis of vortices in superconductors in the context of the famous Ginzburg-Landau model, another and related instance of two-dimensional physics, with the investigation of this phenomenon in dimension 3. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project is about the mathematical analysis of large systems of points, or lines, with Coulomb  interactions. Such systems are ubiquitous in physics models, ranging from quantum  mechanics, statistical mechanics to plasma physics and condensed matter physics, but also in random matrix theory and approximation theory. The main part of the proposal concerns the statistical mechanics of classical Coulomb gases. In a first part it deals with positively charged points. The main questions are to investigate the  effect of temperature on the  local structure of the point configurations, in broad temperature regimes, as well as to understand their possibly universal features. While a lot has been understood in dimension 2, much remains to be done to understand which properties persist in higher dimension, in particular to understand the order of the charge fluctuations and their possibly Gaussian nature, as well as the long-range correlations of the system and free energy expansion. The proposal also aims at understanding  how much of the features are specific to the Coulomb interaction by investigating the same questions for  Riesz gases. A second part concerns the two-dimensional Coulomb gas with opposite charges (or two-component plasma). This is a very important model, related to the XY model in which a similar transition happens, itself an approximation for two-dimensional systems in condensed matter physics  including Josephson junction arrays and thin disordered superconducting granular films. This BKT transition is charcterized by the emergence of dipoles and the transition from exponentially decaying to algebraically decaying correlations. A lot of this behavior is awaiting further mathematical proofs and this is what the project will try to address in the context of the two-component Coulomb gas. Finally the last part of the proposal concerns lines with Coulomb interactions, which arise as vortices in three-dimensional models from superconductivity and superfluidity. The geometry of the lines makes the analysis much more delicate than for points. While many mathematical tools originating in geometric measure theory have been developed for dealing with that aspect, the Coulomb interaction of the lines, the characterization of the onset of vortex lines under an applied magnetic field, and their collective behavior still need to be further investigated. The project's goal is to study all these questions with rigorous mathematical proofs and tools that will mix analysis, PDE, calculus of variations, and probability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Epistemic exclusion is the devaluation of certain types of scholarship that occurs when invisible biases in systems of evaluation are coupled with prejudice toward, and negative stereotypes about, historically underrepresented groups.  Because faculty members' career outcomes (e.g., promotion, tenure, and turnover intentions) are determined by how well they meet evaluative standards, bias in systems of evaluation that disproportionately harm women and faculty of color may impede their retention and advancement in academia. The project team will create and validate a scale assessing faculty epistemic exclusion. <br/><br/>Results of the project have the potential to benefit society by providing a tool that researchers can use to investigate epistemic exclusion in STEM faculty.  Advancing this line of research may result in potential interventions and policy changes at institutions of higher education that improve the retention and promotion of women and underrepresented minority STEM faculty at our nation’s colleges and universities.  There is a plan for dissemination to scholarly audiences through peer-reviewed presentation and publications in professional journals that will help inform the research and academic communities.  <br/><br/>This project is supported by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.

Previous work at Combatant Col demonstrates preservation of annual stratigraphy, water-isotope and geochemical records reflecting important climate and environmental variables including atmospheric circulation, snow accumulation, fire activity, and trans-Pacific dust transport. Existing North Pacific ice cores are located exclusively in Alaska and the Yukon. Combatant Col significantly expands the spatial coverage of ice core records, while simultaneously providing a unique record of hydroclimate in southwestern British Columbia. This project will conduct detailed radar surveys and ice-flow modeling to better understand the glaciological setting and to select the optimal site for drilling. A core to bedrock will be retrieved with logistics supported by the Hakai Cryosphere Node at the University of Northern British Columbia. Analysis of the core included in this project consists of water isotope ratios and visual stratigraphy. In combination with high-resolution radar imaging, the core from Combatant Col will be used to determine whether the observed firn-aquifer at this site (liquid water is stored perennially above the firn-ice transition) has been a persistent feature at the site, or whether it has formed recently, and to determine its impact on glacier energy balance and dynamics.

2001161.xml,SaTC: TTP: Medium: Reducing Container Kernel Attack Surface with TRACKS,NSF,2020-10-01,2024-09-30,1200000,"The infrastructure that powers modern cloud computing environments uses isolated environments called containers to help keep users' data safe. Unfortunately, containers are still vulnerable to flaws in the core operating system (the Linux kernel), which can be used to compromise the security and integrity of container environments. The TRACKS (TRimming Augments Container Kernel Security) project aims to strengthen the security of container environments by hardening the Linux kernel.  The project's novelties are its use of how frequently code is encountered as a way to measure how likely it is to have security flaws.  Prior NSF-supported research has found that frequently-used code is less likely to have serious security vulnerabilities; TRACKS will transition this security metric to practice by placing security monitoring and additional checks into the portions of the Linux kernel that are most likely to be vulnerable and working to incorporate these kernels into real-world cloud environments.  One benefit of this approach is that since the checks are placed in code that is rarely used, the additional security comes at a very low performance cost.  The project's impacts are expected to be a significant improvement in the security of containers using the Linux kernel, which in turn will help protect the safety and privacy of millions of users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TRACKS works by first profiling the execution of the Linux kernel under a wide variety of common container workloads, creating a profile of the most commonly executed code paths. Next, the least commonly used code is instrumented using an LLVM-based compiler pass that can, according to user-defined policies, insert logging, add exploit mitigations such as bounds checking and control flow integrity, or even trigger a shut down of the container when rare code is encountered. In prior work, the investigators found that around 95% of kernel vulnerabilities were located in rarely executed code; as a result, the investigators expect that by creating these hardened kernels and working with cloud infrastructure providers to incorporate them into production environments, a significant improvement in cloud container security can be achieved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002577.xml,Magnetized Outflows from Neutron Star Mergers and Collapsars,NSF,2020-09-01,2024-08-31,454162,"The merger of two extremely dense stellar remnants, or neutron stars, was observed for the first time through gravitational waves and electromagnetic light in 2017.  Although this event, named GW 170817, has been studied extensively, there are aspects of the explosion, called a “kilonova,” which are still not well understood.  Using detailed computer modeling, a research team at Columbia University will investigate in detail how the merged stars may have produced a new neutron star remnant (before ultimately succumbing to gravity and collapsing to a black hole).  They will explore how explosive ejecta flowed out from the merger site, producing heavy atomic nuclei, whose radioactive decay powered the kilonova.  In parallel they will study similar physical conditions that occur following the collapse of a massive star at the end of its nuclear burning life when the star is rotating very rapidly (a so-called ""collapsar""). This work will probe extreme physical processes such as relativistic spacetime around black holes and the extreme densities found in the cores of massive neutron stars. The project also has implications for the origin of the heaviest elements in the Universe. Cataclysmic events, such as neutron star mergers, capture the imagination of students, researchers, and the public alike. Research and educational goals will be integrated in three ways: undergraduate student research, a week-long international school on time-domain gravitational wave astrophysics, and a website disseminated to local teachers for use as classroom educational tools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The binary neutron star merger GW170817 was accompanied by thermal emission (""kilonova""), powered by the radioactive decay of heavy nuclei synthesized via the rapid neutron capture process (r-process). However, the quantity, composition, and velocity of the ejecta needed to match the observations disagree with those predicted by numerical simulations of the dynamical merger phase. Instead, the bulk of the ejecta is best explained as originating in outflows over longer timescales during the post-merger phase, from either a strongly-magnetized neutron star remnant (""millisecond magnetar"") or the neutrino-cooled accretion torus surrounding the compact object. The researchers will explore the properties and kilonova signatures of neutrino-heated magnetized outflows from millisecond magnetar remnants of neutron star mergers and collapsars, both in isolation as well as surrounded by magnetized accretion disks, using three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamical (GRMHD) simulations. The numerical code will be upgraded to include a realistic equation of state (bridging the interior of the neutron star to the lower density wind region) and a neutrino transport scheme to capture the neutrino-driven mass-loading of the winds and the evolution of its electron fraction. A suite of simulations, performed for different neutrino luminosities and mass accretion rates, will cover different epochs in the post-merger evolution. The simulations will address the relative importance and interplay between outflows from the star versus the disk, and their respective baryon-loading.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sub-graph isomorphism, which finds sub-graphs of interest from an enormous data graph, is a fundamental tool for an array of critical applications, e.g., cyber-security, criminal detection and health care. In spite of such a great potential, identifying all isomorphic sub-graphs is a challenge in the Big Data context due to high computation complexity and memory consumption.

When pores are connected, fluids can flow through them. Understanding and predicting fluid flow in porous media is important as it occurs in a wide range of applications, from contamination of groundwater and soil to printing on paper and fabrics. By understanding flow pathways, we can make accurate predictions of the fluid flow, which in turn, will help us design and control related processes. However, predicting fluid flow in porous media is still a long-standing problem. While observing fluid flow in simple two-dimensional porous media can be straightforward, the same is not true in more realistic three-dimensional cases. This proposal aims to carry out an integrated computational and experimental study to provide a more accurate description of flow pathways and realistic fluid flow and the resultant deformations in such materials.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although non-destructive 3D imaging has provided much information about fluid distribution in porous materials, fast and cost-effective 4D pore-scale visualization (i.e., over a period of time) is still very difficult, costly and time-consuming. Furthermore, although visualization of multiphase flow in porous media has been extensively studied in 2D models, there have been very few of such studies in 4D (or even 3D). One goal of this proposal is to develop a 4D method for visualization of two-phase flow in transparent porous media and the deformation that it induces in the media beyond the realm of creeping flow, i.e. when the flow is very slow. This goal will be achieved by collecting 2D images from various angles, which will then be used with a computational algorithm to build a highly detailed 4D image of the multiphase flow. Detailed computations will be carried out in which the two-phase fluid flow and the resulting deformation will be simulated in the same porous media beyond creeping flow. The investigators will also study and identify the critical Reynolds number (Re) at which the transition from the Darcy regime to Forchheimer and eventually turbulent flows occurs. The effect of wettability on the deformation of porous media during two-phase flow will also be investigated. Distinct deformation modes of a porous medium will also be examined under a wide range of Reynolds number and wettability conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the Fluid Dynamics program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It also investigates whether these effects vary according to demographic category.  The study will advance understanding of how employers evaluate and weigh prison certifications when making hiring decisions and the ways formerly incarcerated men navigate the job search process with credentials that send potentially contradictory signals to employers.  Findings will be relevant to the provision and structure of prison credentialing programs and ways decision makers and practitioners can best prepare incarcerated men for the labor market.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data for this project will be collected through: 1) an audit study via online submission of manipulated resumés to employers and 2) interviews with 50 employers and 50 formerly incarcerated people.  In the resumés, possession of a prison apprenticeship certificate and demographic characteristics are manipulated.  Interviews with employers inquire about qualities they perceive help formerly incarcerated people overcome records, precautions taken with formerly incarcerated people who possess prison certifications, and attitudes regarding the quality of prison training. Interviews with formerly incarcerated men ask about prior and current work experience, job satisfaction, motivations for obtaining prison certifications, and the usefulness of prison training in their everyday work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Early Faculty Career Development project supports the generation of knowledge through the building of a firm foundation for a lifetime of leadership in integrating education and research in STEM disciplines. It will examine ways to address a national concern for strengthening students' mathematics competency by enhancing their content knowledge in and motivation for learning mathematics. The study will focus on student motivation for learning as an important predictor of student choice, persistence, and achievement in STEM careers. It will advance research beyond studies that only examine links between motivation and mathematics achievement to lesser known aspects about how motivation functions to support students' in-the-moment choices during learning. The project will: (1) embed experience sampling questions and enhanced choice options within a Spatial Temporal Math digital platform; (2) examine associations between situated student motivation, choice, and academic outcomes; (3) develop nudge interventions based on these associations and iteratively test nudges in a series of experiments within the platform; and (4) assess the impact of nudges in a randomized trial. This project will collect data from over 30K third through fifth grade students for a period of one year.<br/><br/>Experience sampling and data mining methods will be used to collect data about student motivation as they engage Spatial Temporal Math on a digitized mathematics learning platform aligned with state standards. Methods will include surveys, interviews, observations, and other student related tests and school data. Pilot studies will provide data essential to developing interventions that promote deeper learning drawing on motivation theory and behavioral economics. Results from this project will advance theoretical and analytic bases for understanding motivation and choice situated in real-world learning contexts. These new advances will help transform understanding about student motivation and behaviors as well as inform improvements in the teaching and learning of mathematics. In addition to the 30K that will be directly impacted by this study; in real time, the project will help improve learning for more than a million existing users of the digital platform. Thus, results will benefit society by enhancing student content knowledge and motivational practices while simultaneously developing a foundation for being successful in challenging mathematics undertakings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2000681.xml,EAGER: Subtle and Harmful: Millisecond-scale Viral Denial of Service (VDoS) Attacks,NSF,2020-04-01,2024-03-31,200000,"Viral Denial of Service (VDoS) attacks are a new class of attacks that affect the quality of service (QoS) requirements of mission critical web-facing services. These attacks exploit milli-bottlenecks, which are resource saturation conditions of very short duration that result in accumulated queueing delay for resources among inter-dependent components in the n-tier applications used by such services. The attacker can launch this attack by either increasing the rate of submission of job requests (rate of arrival from the service provider's perspective) or by decreasing the rate of job processing (by submitting jobs that are resource intensive). Owing to the very short duration of VDoS attacks (of the order of several milliseconds), they can remain below the detection threshold of typical monitoring tools for traditional denial of service attacks and are, consequently, subtle and stealthy. Nonetheless, they have the potential to cause significant damage. For example, Amazon reported that every 100ms increase in a page load time is correlated to a decrease in sales by 1%; Google requires 99% of its queries to finish within 500ms. This project will investigate the nature and modalities of VDoS attacks and develop mitigation tools to help combat them.  Students at both graduate as well as undergraduate levels will be involved in the research. VDoS experimental data sets as well as tool-sets related to conducting VDoS related experiments will be publicly released.<br/><br/>The project will proceed along two tasks. First, large-scale experiments will be conducted to evaluate the interactions among the various control parameters of VDoS attacks. This part of the study will identify how VDoS attacks occur, what their external manifestations are and how they can be mathematically modeled such that the tradeoffs between the granularity of attack and damage potential can be fully explored.  Second, based on the knowledge acquired through the first task, detection methods and tools will be developed to reproduce and/or evaluate known millisecond-scale VDoS attacks on a testbed and find new ones. This will then lead to mitigation tools for combating VDoS attacks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001624.xml,Collaborative Research: Electrospray Additive Manufacturing of Thin Low Resistance Polyamide-Based Ion Exchange Membranes for Water Treatment,NSF,2020-07-01,2025-06-30,333654,"This grant supports research to develop new knowledge about an electrospray additive manufacturing process to promote the progress of science and to advance national prosperity and well-being by facilitating the manufacture of materials to address water purification challenges and clean water shortages. Electrospray additive manufacturing is a process where organic monomers are deposited onto a surface to form a thin polymer film or membrane. This process carefully controls the way by which these molecules are placed on the surface and can be quickly adapted to manufacture a range of different membrane materials. The electrospray process, in this sense, has significant advantages over conventional film coating or casting processes. An example of one benefit of this approach would be that manufacturers could quickly adapt the process to make tailored water treatment membranes in response to emerging contaminants or pollutants in water. Results from this research benefit the U.S. economy and society by enabling the manufacture of very efficient membranes that provide better access to clean water. This research involves several disciplines including advanced manufacturing, materials science, chemical engineering, and electrochemistry. The use of a multi-disciplinary approach broadens participation of underrepresented groups in research and enhances engineering education and training for the future engineering workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The electrospray additive manufacturing process overcomes fundamental limitations, inherent to conventional manufacturing, that prevent reliable and controlled preparation of very thin polyamide ion exchange membranes with tunable properties. This research addresses knowledge gaps related to the use of electrospray additive manufacturing to enable incorporation of a range of co-monomers into the final membrane. This range of compositions allow the manufacture of materials not previously accessible via conventional manufacturing such as doctor-blade or slot-die casting. The research team prepares and characterizes the membranes to determine if electrospray additive manufacturing can be used to overcome mass transfer, solubility, and reaction kinetics limitations associated with conventional interfacial polymerization manufacturing. Additionally, the team uses the new process to incorporate fixed ionic groups into polyamide membranes to precisely engineer their properties via control of fixed ionic group concentration and cross-link density. Furthermore, the research team demonstrates that the electrospray additive manufacturing process can be used to manufacture membranes on a range of different substrates and that a resistances-in-series model can be used to inform the selection of support substrates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000778.xml,Collaborative Research: Kinetic Inductance in Superconducting Nanowire Microwave Devices,NSF,2020-04-01,2024-03-31,102000,"Proposal Title:<br/>Collaborative Research: Kinetic Inductance in Superconducting Nanowire Microwave Devices<br/><br/><br/>Non-Technical Abstract<br/>Superconducting nanowires can have a kinetic inductance that is several orders of magnitude larger than their magnetic inductance. As a result, high frequency signals on the nanowire experience significant spatial compression as well as a significant reduction in their velocity. The kinetic inductance also varies nonlinearly as a function of the current, creating an opportunity for realizing nonlinear phenomena with extremely minimal dissipation. Through a combination of theory, modeling, and experiment, this project will study these effects in different superconducting nanowire materials and geometries. The understanding gained from these studies will be applied to design new types of ultra-compact microwave devices, which will then be fabricated and characterized. Such devices can serve as important building blocks for the development of more complex systems based on superconducting circuits such as single-photon imagers and quantum computers. This collaborative project brings together groups at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of North Florida, an undergraduate-education focused university, to conduct the proposed research and educational activities, combining the best aspects of both institutions. In particular, the involvement of the University of North Florida creates additional opportunities for undergraduates from diverse backgrounds to participate in the research.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>The goal of this project is to create a new superconducting nanowire device platform that can serve as the basis of a monolithic superconducting nanowire microwave integrated circuit technology. This goal will be pursued through four approaches. The first approach is based on exploring materials and geometries that maximize the nanowire's kinetic inductivity, which will result in extremely large characteristic impedances (> 10 kohm) along with slow signal velocities and large spatial compression of the signal wavelengths. Such high impedances create strong decoupling from the environment and have potential applications ranging from the readout of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors to the design of quantum bits. The second approach will be to fabricate nanowires on extremely high permittivity substrates such as strontium titanate, which has been shown to have a relative permittivity as high as 10,000 at low temperature. This extremely large permittivity will significantly boost the capacitance, bringing the characteristic impedance of high-inductance nanowires close to 50 kohm while simultaneously achieving ultra-slow signal velocities and ultra-compressed signal wavelengths. A 50 kohm impedance is critical to coupling with conventional microwave circuitry. The third approach will focus on understanding and exploiting the nonlinear current-dependence of kinetic inductance in order to create new types of nanowire-based nonlinear microwave devices. Examples of such devices include mixers, tunable couplers, switches, and parametric amplifiers. In order to understand these devices, the project will seek to address fundamental questions such as how quickly the nanowire's kinetic inductance can be modulated, how much loss is associated with this modulation, and how the nonlinearity and the loss depend on the signal power. The fourth approach will leverage the results generated in the first three approaches to develop more complex nanowire-based devices and circuits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2000851.xml,"Enabling Adaptive Voltage Regulation: Control, Machine Learning, and Circuit Design",NSF,2019-07-01,2022-07-31,304174,"Supply voltage regulation serves the critical role of delivering power to on-chip devices at well-regulated voltage levels. Voltage regulation presents key design challenges of electronic systems ranging from high-performance microprocessors to mobile system-on-a-chips. In such systems, the ever-growing need for processing capability must be fulfilled while staying within specified power, thermal, and battery-life limits.  Power must be managed and delivered while maximizing system power efficiency in every possible way. The proposed research aims to address the above voltage regulation challenges by taking an interdisciplinary approach.  Innovations in control, machine learning, and circuit design will be developed to enable adaptive supply voltage regulation systems involving a variety of on-chip/off-chip voltage regulators. The expected outcomes of this project will help build new generations of highly efficient circuits and systems that can self-adapt to varying operating conditions. The synergies between circuit/system design, control-theoretical exploration, and machine learning as pursued in this project will promote a new interdisciplinary direction for advancing electronic system design.  The depth and breadth of this research will expose students to outstanding educational and training opportunities. Participation from undergraduate and underrepresented students is an important education mission of this project and will be promoted through recruiting and outreaching. The anticipated results from this project are expected to be broad and will be widely disseminated as well as brought to classroom to benefit undergraduate and graduate curriculum.  Collaboration and interaction with industry constitutes an important channel for this project to impact the real world, which will be actively pursued.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is based on the vision that the ultimate quality and efficiency in supply voltage regulation may be best achieved via a heterogeneous chain of voltage processing starting from on-board switching voltage regulators (VRs), to in-package/on-chip switching VRs, and finally to networks of distributed on-chip linear VRs.  Heterogeneous voltage regulation (HVR) systems are promising as they encompass regulators with complimentary tradeoffs in response time, size, efficiency, and cost. The ultimate aim of this project is to enable HVR systems that will guarantee power integrity, incur minimal power loss, and autonomously adapt to workload changes and system/environmental uncertainties at multiple temporal scales.  The above goal will be achieved by pursuing an integrated solution of novel control theory, circuits, and machine-learning enabled autonomous adaptation. Rigorous design techniques for decentralized and centralized control will be developed for distributed on-chip linear regulator networks and the HVR system with guaranteed stability and regulation performance.  Efficient machine-learning algorithms and their on-chip integration will be employed to provide accurate real-time prediction of time-varying load currents. Autonomous adaptation of the HVR system will be supported by power-efficient control policies that preemptively adapt on-chip linear regulator networks and on-chip/off-chip VRs based on machine-learning predicted future current loads.  Coping with system uncertainties is another key objective and will be achieved via deployment of control policies that are self-tuned by machine learning to attain the optimal power efficiency.  The project will explore system-level design optimization to jointly optimize regulation performance, power efficiency, and design overhead across all voltage processing stages in a HVR system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This shift to data-driven decision making is creating a growing workforce demand for Data Science and Analytics professionals.  In a 2018 report, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics projected that jobs in data science and analytics will grow 34% by 2026.  However, thus far, very few two-year institutions offer data analytics programs that could prepare students for entry-level positions in data science and analytics.  To create new pathways into data science and analytics careers, this project intends to establish a college credit-based certificate in data analytics.  In concert with this goal, it also aims to increase the College’s capacity for high quality data science instruction and to broaden participation in data science, with a focus on inclusion of women.  In addition to its potential to increase the capacity and quality of the data science workforce in New Jersey, the project may also provide a model for other institutions that are interested in building new data science programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major goal of the project is to develop a 15-credit data science certificate that integrates technology such as R, Tableau, Python, and SQL into the curriculum.

The first component of this study is to identify the causes of overrepresentation in the criminal justice system as compared to the general population by examining offending patterns and arrest disparities. The second component is to identify and document trajectories of the group through the criminal justice system, from initial contact via arrest or detainment, through incarceration, ending with re-entry to society.  Members of this group are likely to face challenges at each step of the process that can cause negative consequences such as poorer health, difficulties finding employment, and housing instability. Further, they may be more likely to re-offend following re-entry to society, posing a potentially increased risk to themselves and their broader communities. Findings of this project are relevant to decision making that may lead to decreased risk of offending among this population and more successful rehabilitation and reentry processes.  They also provide information that may contribute to the improvement of law enforcement practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the project, three aims are addressed: 1) identifying the impact of state-level policies and state-level social climates on substance abuse and criminality in the group; (2) documenting common experiences during interactions with law enforcement; and (3) identifying unique challenges faced by reentering members of the group.  Several methods are used.  For the quantitative portion, a comprehensive dataset of state-level policies and social climates is constructed and merged with an existing, nationally representative dataset to test the effects of these policies and climates on substance abuse variables.

Plants mine the soil to extract minerals and in so doing, may take up antibiotics produced by soil microorganisms that adversely affect normal plant function. How plants maintain adequate nutrition while limiting the uptake of antibiotics is unknown. We specifically investigate metal uptake in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and its resistance to the antibiotic kanamycin. We propose a model in which the interplay among various transporters explains the trade-offs between metal uptake and antibiotic resistance. Our approach that combines mathematical modeling and experimental validation would allow us to examine these otherwise complex interactions that are not intuitive. Moreover the project provides an excellent opportunity for interdisciplinary training of undergraduate students at Spelman College, a Historically Black College for women. Overall, the project will contribute to enhancing the educational environment through research, curriculum and student development opportunities.<br/><br/>Fe and Zn are among the most abundant micronutrients found in plants. Their uptake and movement in the plant is highly regulated. Our preliminary results showed a link between metal uptake in plants and antibiotic resistance. Most notably, Fe uptake declined in plants exposed to kanamycin. We propose a model that integrates what is known about Fe and Zn homeostasis with the effects of the antibiotic kanamycin. Besides Fe, Zn and kanamycin, other factors taken into consideration are the main chelators of Fe and Zn, citrate and nicotianamine (NA), and their known or assumed transporters. The model is centered on xylem loading, a critical step prior for the long distance transport of nutrients.

Researchers will use a design-based approach to partner with rural school districts to<br/>introduce students to high-need STEM career fields using virtual reality technology and career exploration modules.  They will also guide students in assessing their potential fit for these fields. The researchers hypothesize that student career decision making self-efficacy and career outcome expectations will statistically improve as a result of the intervention. The project will be<br/>implemented in two stages: development of the curriculum modules and then implementation of the intervention<br/>with research being conducted concurrently. The project is designed to broaden participation in the STEM workforce for those in rural communities, particularly women and underrepresented groups, by exposing students and school counselors to potential high-need careers.<br/><br/>Guided by social cognitive career theory, the researchers will employ an experimental design with randomization within clusters to measure the effectiveness of the intervention by investigating four research questions: (1) What is the magnitude of the<br/>effect of a STEM career exploration intervention using virtual reality technology on student career decision making self-efficacy, career outcome expectations, and knowledge of the targeted careers? (2) How do student inputs of gender, race/ethnicity,<br/>and personality impact the effects of participation in the career intervention on outcomes of career decision making self-efficacy, career outcome expectations, and knowledge of the targeted careers? (3) How does student socio-economic status impact the effects of<br/>participation in the career intervention on outcomes of career decision making self-efficacy, career outcome expectations, and knowledge of the targeted careers? and (4) How do students characterize the effectiveness of the career exploration intervention<br/>in developing their understanding of, and interest in, the target careers? Data will be collected pre- and post-intervention. Additionally, student focus groups will be used to collect data from a representative sample of students from the treatment<br/>condition at each school.

2003019.xml,III: Medium: Collaborative Research: Multi-level computational approaches to protein function prediction,NSF,2019-09-25,2022-03-31,150016,"Proteins are the workhorse molecules of life which participate in nearly every activity of cellular processes, including signal transduction, enzyme catalysis, structural support, bodily movement, and defense against pathogens. Interpretation of specific functional roles that each protein molecule plays in cell is thus critical for us to understand the fundamental principles of the biological processes and to design new drug treatments to regulate the processes for improving human health. The task is however highly non-trivial in modern molecular biology studies. The most accurate method to interpret protein biological functions is through structural biology and biochemistry experiments. But the cost of the experimental studies is high, and the process is too slow for large-scale application due to the involvement of manual skill and data processing. As a result, the majority of proteins in human and other important species remain unknown despite decades of efforts. The lack of genome-wide protein function information has significantly impeded the progress of system biology studies aiming at a comprehensive understanding of the life process. In this project, the investigators plan to develop advanced computational methods for automatic and yet reliable protein function annotations. The developed methods and databases will be freely released to the scientific community, which can be used for large-scale and genome-wide protein function annotation studies. The project will also provide opportunities to promote participations of underrepresented groups, including women and African Americans, in computational biology education and method developments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Built on the assumption that similar sequences have similar function, a routine approach to computational protein function annotations is comparative modeling, which deduces functions of target proteins from known homologous proteins. However, the accuracy and coverage of the approach are limited due to the diversity of gene evolution. Significant progress has been recently achieved in protein 3D structure prediction and the state-of-the-art algorithms can generate high-quality structures for distant-homology proteins with an unprecedented capacity. This project seeks to explore various new ideas to enhance the accuracy of distant-homology protein function annotations by using 3D models from the cutting-edge protein structure predictions, with a focus on ligand-protein binding interactions, gene ontology and post-translational modifications. Meanwhile, thermal motion and intrinsic disordering of protein structures are integrated in the pipelines for better function annotations. While the proposed approaches do not expect to address all the fundamental issues, like the first-principle methods, as of how and why proteins fold and function, the success of the studies should help establish a practical knowledge-based relation of structure and function that can be used for genome-scale applications with models useful for guiding new experimental design, and thus significantly enhance the impact of protein structure modeling on biological studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2000495.xml,Collaborative Research: Paving the Way for Fractions: Exploring Foundational Concepts in First Grade,NSF,2020-06-01,2025-05-31,1728375,"Although fractions represent a crucial topic in early childhood education, many students develop only a tenuous grasp of fraction concepts, even after several years of fraction instruction that is aligned with current standards. The goal of this project, led by a team of researchers at the University of Delaware and Temple University, is to answer important questions about the informal understandings of fractions young children have before they come to school and what their relations are to fraction learning in more formal instructional settings. Proficiency with fractions dramatically increases the likelihood of students succeeding in math, which in turn increases participation in the STEM workforce. Importantly, large individual differences in fraction understandings are apparent at the start of fractions instruction in the intermediate grades. Early fraction misunderstandings cascade into more severe math weaknesses in later grades, especially when instruction may shift abruptly from whole numbers to fractions. There is a critical need to understand the roots of individual differences that arise before formal instruction takes place. Young children possess important informal fraction understandings before they come to school, but the range of these abilities and their role in formal fraction learning and development is not well understood. The goal of this project is: a) to investigate the extent to which individual differences in informal fraction-related knowledge in first-grade children are associated with short- and longer-term fractions and math outcomes; and b) to see whether there is a causal link between level of informal fraction-related knowledge and the ability to profit from fractions instruction that directly builds on this knowledge. The findings from the project hold promise for informing early childhood educators how fractions can be incorporated in the first-grade curriculum in new and meaningful ways. Though the findings should be beneficial to all students, the project will specifically target members of groups underrepresented in STEM fields, including ethnic and racial minority and low-income students. The project is jointly funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning, and by the Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12), which supports the research and development of innovative resources, models and tools in order to enhance STEM learning and teaching by pre-K-12 students and teachers. <br/><br/>The project design includes both an observational study and an experimental study. The observational study will: (1) document individual differences in informal fraction-related knowledge in first grade; (2) determine concurrent relations between this informal knowledge and general cognitive and whole number competencies; and (3) examine whether informal fraction-related knowledge at the beginning of first grade uniquely predicts math outcomes at the end. The experimental study will explore the extent to which first graders’ informal and formal fraction concepts can be affected by training. The researchers will test whether training on the number line, which is continuous and closely aligned with the mental representation of the magnitude of all real numbers, will help students capitalize on their informal fraction understandings of proportionality, scaling, and equal sharing as well as their experience with integers to learn key fraction concepts. Together, the synergistic studies will pinpoint the role informal fraction knowledge in learning key fraction concepts. All data will be collected in Delaware schools serving socioeconomically and ethnically diverse populations of students. Primary measures include assessments of informal fraction knowledge (proportional reasoning, spatial scaling, equal sharing), executive functioning, vocabulary, whole number knowledge, whole number/fraction number line estimation, formal fraction knowledge, and broad mathematics achievement (calculation, fluency, applied problems).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002653.xml,Metal-Sensitive Functionalization and Self-Assembly of Bimetallic Nanocrystals,NSF,2021-01-01,2024-12-31,450000,"The Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program in the Chemistry Division supports Professor Dong Qin and her group at the Georgia Institute of Technology to develop tiny crystals called bimetallic nanocrystals.  Their bimetallic nanocrystals contain two metals whose chemical function and spatial position within the nanocrystals are precisely controlled.  Metal nanocrystals play a vital role in enabling catalysis for energy conversion, environmental protection, and organic synthesis. Despite some success, it remains a daunting challenge to monitor the catalytic reactions in real time by spatially confining the reactants to the catalytic sites while detecting the final and intermediate products in situ. The research team addresses this challenge by developing bimetallic nanocrystals in which one of the metals can serve as a catalyst while the other can report the ‘chemical fingerprint’ (signals associated with the reaction). The concepts, materials, and methods developed during this research may find use in a broad range of applications related to solid-state chemistry, catalysis, sensing, and photonics. This team recruits women and minority students as well as those from community colleges and minority institutions for summer research.  This effort is carried out in collaboration with the National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure called the Southeastern Nanotechnology Infrastructure Corridor. <br/><br/>In this research supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program, Professor Qin’s team develops new design principles and methods to fabricate a novel class of bifunctional nanoreactors from Ag@M (M: Pt, Pd, and Rh) core-frame nanocubes via metal-selective surface functionalization and self-assembly. Specifically, molecules bearing isocyanide groups at the two ends are used to selectively bind to the M atoms on the edges of the core-frame nanocubes, serving as “clips” to bring two nanocubes face to face for the generation of a dimer. The gap region between the two nanocubes naturally presents a well-controlled nanoreactor, in which the side faces can be orthogonally functionalized with the reactants while the M atoms not coordinated by isocyanide will serve as the catalyst. Due to a strong plasmonic coupling between the two Ag nanocubes separated by a gap of only a few nanometers, the nanoreactor offers a unique capability to monitor various types of important catalytic reactions by in situ SERS. The model reactions include the hydrogenation of nitroaromatics for the production of thermodynamically unfavorable products such as hydroxylamine and azo compounds, as well as the bond-selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde, a catalytic reaction pivotal to the production of fragrance, agrochemical, and pharmaceutical compounds. This research not only enables real-time characterization of heterogeneous catalytic reactions but also sheds light on the rational design of new or improved catalyst materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001914.xml,Collaborative Research: Windows of Opportunity-Understanding Black Male Engineers in the Pursuit of Advanced Degrees,NSF,2019-07-23,2023-08-31,174325,"Producing graduates with science, technology, engineering and mathematics competencies continues to be a national concern and priority. Research has suggested the United States workforce may suffer a deficit of one million STEM graduates over the next decade. Annually, less than half of the three million students who enter U.S. colleges intending to major in a STEM field persist in STEM until graduation. The situation is worse among groups (i.e., African American, Hispanic, and Native American) traditionally underrepresented in STEM. For example, in engineering, underrepresented groups account for just 16% of all undergraduate students; those who decided to major in engineering switch to non-STEM fields before graduation twice as often as White students. The representation of Black males particularly continues to be a challenge. Each year, about 64% of White males earn a bachelor's degree in engineering, compared to about 5% of African American males. At the graduate level, Black males only account for 3% and 1.7% of STEM master's and doctoral degrees, respectively. Moreover, Black males account for 3.6% of the engineering workforce and a dismal 2.5% of engineering faculty. This collaborative research focuses on understanding the factors that influence the decisions of Black males to pursue advanced engineering degrees, uncovering the assets/strengths that Black males possess who persist or plan to continue in engineering beyond the baccalaureate degree, and determining the role of academic self-concept and engineering identity in the intent to pursue advanced engineering degrees. This study includes Black male engineering students, advanced degree holders and faculty from a Predominantly White Institution (University of Connecticut), a Hispanic-serving institution (University of Houston), a Historically Black University (Prairie View Agricultural &amp; Mechanical University) and from members of the National Society of Black Engineers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project pursues three research questions: 1) What factors influenced Black males to pursue graduate degrees in engineering? 2) What assets/strengths do Black males possess who persist or plan to continue in engineering beyond undergraduate studies? 3) What role does academic self-concept and engineering identity play in the intent to pursue advanced degrees among Black males? To answer these questions, the project employs a mixed-method approach. Data sources include formal semi-structured interviews and surveys. This project uniquely contributes to research literature on cultural capital, anti-deficit achievement, and engineering identity work. The evaluation uses a values-engaged, educative approach. This work stands to influence the recruitment and retention of engineering graduate students and give insight into creating a pipeline for Black male engineering faculty.

This period of dramatic social change involved the collapse of rulers and ruling institutions as well as the depopulation of cities and, in some cases, entire regions. For decades, archaeologists and paleoecologists have debated the role of environmental change in the collapse but have had difficulty in establishing causal connections between environmental and social change. Much of the debate over the causes and consequences of environmental change results from the lack of transdisciplinary projects designed to address the specific ways in which environmental change impacted social and environmental systems. Such a transdisciplinary approach is crucial for demonstrating the causes of societal collapse, making the project transformative for research on political collapse more generally. This project includes STEM education and educator development; increased public scientific literacy and engagement, support of full participation of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM research, and development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce. STEM education will involve development of educational resources for students in K12 to college. Public scientific literacy and engagement will be facilitated through the continued development of a bilingual website, and through workshops for host communities. Meaningful research experiences will be provided to twelve undergraduate and graduate students, many of whom are women and members of underrepresented minorities in STEM. Collaborations will enhance transdisciplinary approaches to understanding societal collapse and environmental change, and forge new collaborations for future research.<br/><br/>The project integrates archaeological, geoarchaeological, paleoecological, paleoclimatological, and bioarchaeological fieldwork and laboratory analyses designed to test hypotheses concerning the role of environmental change and human impact on the environment in societal collapse. Prior research on the Classic-period collapse has tended to focus on specific sites or small regions. This study focusses on two interrelated, but contrasting, ecological regions: a semi-tropical lowland and a temperate highland region. This innovative comparative approach to societal collapse allows for the examination of the human and environmental components of the socio-environmental system and their interrelationships that promote or inhibit resilience and vulnerabilities to societal collapse in the two regions. Archaeological excavations at the two sites will examine the impact of environmental and landscape degradation on land use, domestic economy, and human health and diet during the Late Classic and Early Postclassic periods. Geoarchaeological research will examine changes in land use and landscape degradation by focusing on agricultural terraces while floodplain geomorphologic analysis will examine human and climatological impacts on the river system. Lake sediment cores and their biological and chemical signatures will be investigated to determine environmental change and human landscape impacts. Chronological precision will be achieved through a combination of radiocarbon, paleomagnetism, and optically stimulated luminescence dating, while chronological modeling will more effectively link the diverse datasets. By combining these different datasets, this research will provide a novel detailed paleoclimatological record for the study region. The results will provide a long-term perspective on current and future problems facing humanity by contributing to models of long-term environmental change and human impacts on the environment with implications for future land use planning and resource management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The solution set forms a geometric object. The main idea is to study the rich and beautiful interplay between its geometric and algebraic properties. Closely related to this is the concept of a free resolution, which was introduced by the famous mathematician David Hilbert in two papers in 1890 and 1893. Constructing a free resolution amounts to repeatedly solving systems of polynomial equations.

2001128.xml,"Non-Commutative Spaces, Their Symmetries, and Geometric Quantum Group Theory",NSF,2020-08-01,2024-07-31,174996,"The project fits within the scope of the branch of mathematics known as noncommutative geometry, originating primarily in the discovery early in the 20th century that the then-newly-discovered phenomena of quantum mechanics require a novel mathematical formalism. The main point of departure from classical (or non-quantum) mathematics is the fact that by the very small-scale nature of our ambient world, certain pairs of measurable physical quantities cannot be measured simultaneously (with the momentum and position of a particle serving as the preeminent example). Mathematically, this manifests as the non-commutativity of a pair of transformations on a physical system, justifying the name ""noncommutative"" for the relevant field of study. The formal objects that model the symmetries (that is, structure-preserving transformations) of a physical system modeled according to this paradigm are known as a ""quantum groups"", and they are the central theme of the present research proposal. The training of graduate students is an important part of this project.<br/><br/>A number of broader themes inform the problems under consideration. As one example, discrete quantum groups, like their classical counterparts, fall into a constellation of taxonomic classes based on the approximation properties enjoyed by their group algebras. The quantum versions of the classical results are typically more technically demanding, only partially settled, and good test beds for the strengths of the geometric-group-theoretic and operator-algebraic techniques that jointly make classical discrete groups such rich geometric and analytical objects. In another direction, much light can be shed on the structure and above-mentioned approximation properties of quantum groups (discrete or more generally, locally compact) by category and representation-theoretic means. For that reason, results to the effect that group-theoretic data (e.g. the center of a locally compact quantum group) can be reconstructed from categories of unitary representations with their underlying structure are of some interest in the field and the project. As a third example, randomness features heavily in the study of groups and other discrete objects (probabilistic methods are very important in graph theory, for instance); the general phenomenon whereby a ""generic"" object, constructed randomly (with the technical meaning of that phrase depending on the specifics of the problem) tends to be highly asymmetric appears to replicate in the quantum setting, with ""most"" finite graphs, finite metric spaces, etc. admitting no quantum symmetries. Such generic rigidity results always recover their classical counterparts (given that quantum symmetries always encompass ordinary ones), but usually require more involved and often more enlightening proof techniques. It is hoped the requisite eclectic mix of approaches to the problems (combinatorial, representation-theoretic, probabilistic, operator-algebraic, etc.) will offer insight not only into the nature of the quantum-mathematical objects ostensibly being studied, but also into the classical versions thereof.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2001832.xml,Doctoral Dissertation Research: Algorithmic Pretrial Risk Assessments in the Courtroom,NSF,2020-02-15,2021-06-30,15999,"Across the United States, there are ongoing efforts to improve policies and practices that govern whether a defendant may be released from custody while his or her criminal case is pending. As part of these reforms, communities are increasingly adopting pretrial risk assessments, tools intended to help judges make fairer, more informed decisions by summarizing an arrestee’s risk of missing a future court date or committing a crime if released. This project will examine how a popular algorithmic risk assessment influences discussions among judges, prosecutors, and defense attorneys in hearings in which decisions about bail and pretrial release are made. It will investigate how access to risk assessment reports shapes the questions judges ask and the rationales they offer for their decisions, the arguments prosecutors and defense attorneys advance, and the tone of hearings. By shedding light on how risk assessment tools are used in practice, this project will help courts weighing whether to adopt these tools to better understand what impact they may have in their communities.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project leverages a randomized controlled trial (RCT) running in select counties that randomizes whether the judge, prosecutor, and defense attorney in a given case receive a copy of the arrestee’s risk score report. Transcripts of initial appearances will be collected for a random sample of cases in the RCT. Through qualitative coding and computational text analysis, the study will compare 1) hearings before and after the adoption of the pretrial risk assessment, and 2) following adoption, hearings where risk score reports are provided and hearings where they are not. This analysis will be further enriched with in-person courtroom observation and semi-structured interviews. Findings from this project will contribute to sociological and criminological theory on risk scoring, legal decision-making, and how algorithmic decision aids shape professional practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002522.xml,Collaborative Research: Probabilistic Debris Modeling in Coastal Storm Events: A Case of Complex Coupling Between Human-Built-Natural Systems,NSF,2020-08-15,2024-07-31,276068,"Natural disasters, like hurricanes, tropical storms, and flood events, can generate massive amounts of debris, posing significant challenges to coastal communities. Financial and logistical burdens related to debris removal account for nearly a third of reimbursed recovery costs, and threats to public safety range from impaired emergency response to health hazards. There is need for more accurate models to estimate debris presence and quantities after, and preferably prior to a storm, so communities can better prepare for and manage debris burdens. Knowledge about what drives debris patterns is limited, so current predictive models are not accurate enough to support planning or response, particularly for multi-hazard storm events. In addition, coastal landscapes are constantly changing, and as development patterns shift so do prospective debris volumes and locations. This project addresses the need for integrative models that reflect the complex coupling between human-built-natural systems that underpin debris generation in storm events and the cascading impacts on coastal communities. This project examines the drivers of debris patterns and also develops models that couple those insights with infrastructure, socio-demographic, and human health impacts, among others. Resulting insights can inform policy decisions, coastal planning and risk mitigation, and debris management.  Synthesis of model outcomes and policy implications will be shared via web hosted interactive story mapping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will transform our understanding of debris generation from coastal storms and its cascading consequences on communities by deriving coupled models of the interactions between human-built-natural systems. New methods will be developed for probabilistic modeling of debris presence and volumes, harnessing and fusing empirical data from past events, storm simulations, and physics-based estimates of fragility. A significant departure from traditional debris prediction models will be afforded by introducing nested statistical surrogate models informed by multi-resolution land use/land cover characteristics, physical vulnerability of structures or vegetation, and multi-hazard storm intensities. As a result, coupled models of development and debris potential are enabled for the first time to explore current and future storm risks and policy scenarios. By integrating models of the cascading consequences of debris with socio-demographic characteristics, this project will also shed new light on relationships between regional debris effects and social vulnerability that can inform future planning, management and mitigation efforts. Knowledge co-production and the practical viability of research methods will be advanced by working with stakeholders in testbed communities, to increase the likelihood that resulting models will be useful for future plans and decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2003389.xml,Upgrade of an Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) System to Establish a Center for State-of-the-Art Microstructural Analyses,NSF,2020-07-01,2022-06-30,165527,"This award will fund the upgrade of an electron backscatter diffraction system housed at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) in Woods Hole, MA. The upgraded system will facilitate cutting-edge research into the microscopic properties of Earth materials, foster collaboration among MBL and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), and establish WHOI/MBL as a regional center for state-of-the-art electron backscatter diffraction analyses. Electron backscatter diffraction has proven invaluable for examining the structure and composition of rocks, minerals, metals, and biominerals. The upgraded instrumentation will form a core component in the research program of the principle investigator, who is a new junior faculty member at WHOI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numerous geodynamic phenomena arise from the angstrom-to centimeter-scale creep of rocks and minerals. To understand Earth’s interior dynamics, electron backscatter diffraction is routinely used to quantify lattice preferred orientations, grain sizes, mis-orientations, and mineral phase distributions, and thereby examine the micro-mechanical properties of deformed rocks. Equally, insights into biomineralization, coral reef growth, volcanic eruption dynamics, magma flow, meteorite formation, and impact metamorphism may be gleaned from electron backscatter diffraction analyses of Earth and planetary materials. Within the fields of materials science and engineering, recent technological innovations have afforded remarkable improvements in electron backscatter diffraction-based methods. This award will support the upgrade and acquisition of cutting-edge electron backscatter diffraction equipment, including: 1) a CMOS-based electron backscatter diffraction detector, capable of collecting 3000 data points per second; 2) a software license to enable high-angular-resolution (HR-) electron backscatter diffraction analyses; and 3) sample holders for high-spatial-resolution Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction (TKD) analyses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001135.xml,"Collaborative Research: SpecEES:  Towards Energy and Spectrally Efficient Millimeter Wave MIMO Platforms - A Unified System, Circuits, and Machine Learning Framework",NSF,2019-10-01,2021-02-28,450000,"Wireless networks have played a transformative societal role since their inception. The development of the next generation of wireless networks is a national priority for the United States and other countries around the world. As of 2019, 5G wireless networks are in early stages of deployment, and have the goals of being able to support rapidly increasing mobile data traffic with low latency across billions of devices, while reducing overall network energy consumption and cost. The deployment of 5G networks in their most advanced form is expected to take several years lasting well into the 2020's. However, consumer demands that drive wireless network capacity is projected to continue unabated, especially as new application scenarios such as autonomous transportation and delivery networks mature. In anticipation of such needs, this project seeks to investigate hardware and physical layer needs of ""beyond 5G"" networks by taking a unified approach that encompasses circuits, systems and artificial intelligence. The  proposed  theories,  algorithms,  and  hardware  implementation  are expected to have impacts  in  a  number  of  areas  that  include technology transfer to industry,  development  of  undergraduate and graduate course materials, graduate student training, undergraduate research experiences and community outreach via wireless testbed development, and public release of all simulation frameworks and machine learning datasets.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research goal of this project is to develop a set of analysis and design tools for mm-wave MIMO systems including specific circuits-aware signal processing techniques, and novel algorithms-aware circuit designs. Fundamental algorithmic contributions will be made to solve key mm-wave MIMO system challenges such as enhancing the spectral efficiency and energy efficiency in highly-mobile applications and dense mm-wave deployments. Fundamental circuit contributions will include solutions to designing energy-efficient MIMO transmitters, designing energy- and area-efficient RF precoders and combiners, and designing platforms to support machine learning algorithms. The project has several inter-related thrusts: (1) Investigate joint system/circuit analysis and design approaches for hybrid architectures; (2) Develop novel circuits (including high-efficiency transmitters and bi-directional signal paths) to enable high energy-efficiency, reconfigurability and concurrent multi-band operation in hybrid MIMO architectures (3) Adopt machine learning tools to design circuits- and deployment-aware beamforming codebooks, and leverage machine learning techniques to design mm-wave interference-aware beamforming; (5) Integrate into MIMO platforms with appropriate sensors and actuators to enable hardware implementation of the aforementioned machine learning techniques&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001212.xml,Collaborative Research: Assessing the role of compound-specific phosphorus hydrolase transformations in the marine phosphorus cycle,NSF,2019-09-01,2022-08-31,499786,"Phosphorus (P) is an essential building block for life.  Because P is in short supply over vast areas of the ocean, P availability may control biological productivity, such as photosynthesis and carbon fixation, which has implications for uptake of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and thus climate regulation.  Marine microorganisms must satisfy their nutritional requirement for P by obtaining it from seawater, where P is present in a variety of chemical forms, from simple phosphate ions (Pi) to complex dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) molecules.  The concentration of DOP vastly exceeds Pi over most ocean areas, therefore DOP is a critically important source of P for marine microbial nutrition and productivity. However, much remains unknown about the contribution of specific DOP compounds to the P nutrition, productivity, and structure of marine microbial communities.  In this project, the investigators will conduct field experiments in the Atlantic Ocean and perform a series of controlled laboratory studies with pure enzymes and microbial cultures to determine how and to what extent different DOP compounds are degraded to Pi in the marine environment.  Furthermore, the contribution of these compound-specific DOP molecules to microbial P nutrition, carbon fixation, and community structure will be determined, thus advancing the current state of knowledge regarding the factors that control the activity and distribution of microbial species in the ocean, and the ocean?s role in the climate system.  This project will support two female junior investigators, a postdoctoral researcher, and graduate and undergraduate students.  The undergraduate students will be recruited from the Marine Sciences program at Savannah State University, an Historically Black Colleges and Universities.  In addition, results will be incorporated into new hands-on K-12 educational tools to teach students about microbial P biogeochemistry, including a digital game and formal lesson plans with hands-on demos. These tools will be validated with K-12 educators and will be widely accessible to the public through various well-known online platforms. These activities will thus reach a broad audience including a significant fraction of underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;P is a vital nutrient for life.  Marine microorganisms utilize P-hydrolases, such as alkaline phosphatase (AP), to release and acquire phosphate (Pi) from a wide diversity of dissolved organic P (DOP) compounds, including P-esters (P-O-C bonds), phosphonates (P-C), and polyphosphates (P-O-P). Compound-specific DOP transformations have the potential to exert critical and wide-ranging impacts on marine microbial ecology (e.g. variable DOP bioavailability among species), biogeochemistry (e.g. P geologic sequestration via formation of calcium Pi), and global climate (e.g. aerobic production of the greenhouse gas methane by dephosphorylation of methylphosphonate). However, the mechanisms and comparative magnitude of specific DOP transformations, in addition to their relative contributions to microbial community-level P demand, productivity, and structure, are not completely understood. This study will fill these knowledge gaps by tracking the fate of specific DOP pools in the marine environment. Specifically, this project will test four hypotheses in the laboratory using recombinant enzymes and axenic cultures representative of marine eukaryotic and prokaryotic plankton from high and low nutrient environments, and in the field using observational and experimental approaches along natural Pi gradients in the Atlantic Ocean. In particular, the investigators will reveal potential differences in the hydrolysis and utilization of specific DOP compounds at the community- (bulk enzymatic assays), taxon- (cell sorting of radiolabeled cells in natural samples), species- (axenic cultures) and molecular-levels (pure enzyme kinetic studies and cell-associated proteomes and exoproteomes).  Results from our proposed work will provide a robust understanding of the enzymatic basis involved in the transformation of specific forms of DOP and create new knowledge on the relative contribution of these specific P sources to Pi production, marine microbial nutrition, community structure, primary productivity, and thus global carbon cycling and climate. In particular, our refined measurements of the concentration of bioavailable DOP and our unique estimates of DOP remineralization fluxes will provide critical new information to improve models of marine primary production and P cycling."
2001546.xml,Digitization TCN: Collaborative Research: Mobilizing Millions of Marine Mollusks of the Eastern Seaboard,NSF,2020-09-15,2024-08-31,58762,"The Eastern Seaboard of the United States (ESB, U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone) stretches from the Canadian border on the Atlantic along nearly 6,000 km of eastern coastline, around the Floridian Peninsula, and along the Gulf of Mexico to the south end of the Texan coast, including 18 U.S. states. The ESB region is densely populated, with 47% of the U.S. population expected to inhabit the counties adjacent to the shoreline by 2021. Habitat loss, pollution, overfishing, and climate change threaten commercially and ecologically important marine species all along the ESB. This project will make occurrence data with map coordinates available for over 3,000 species of mollusks that find their habitat along the ESB, including mussels, clams, conchs, snails, and squid. Data from these ecologically and commercially important species (over 4.5 million individual specimens) will be made available through public online data portals. While the geographic ranges for many species of mollusks are well-known, the extent of their distribution within the seafloor habitats they occupy is unknown. Adding map coordinates to occurrence records for live-collected mollusks in natural history collections will provide detailed knowledge of distributions. Because natural history collections have specimens collected from the mid-1800s to present, these occurrence records can help track distributional changes over time and lead to better fisheries and conservation management.  <br/><br/>One hundred million mollusk specimens have been documented in natural history collections across North America, and the breadth, depth, and growth of these collections is exceptionally well-known compared to other invertebrate taxa. Mollusks are among the best sampled group of animals, with some species having over 2,000 digital records available in natural history collections making them extremely well-suited for environmental and biogeographical studies that track faunal change over time and space. However, already-digitized mollusk lots are missing essential data such as collecting date (30% of records) and reliable georeferences (85% of records). This project will generate reliable geo-coordinate data for all covered specimen lots using a collaborative georeferencing project in GeoLocate.  GeoLocate will add layers for bathymetric data, benthic habitat, and marine conservation areas. Incorporating bathymetry into GeoLocate to determine the extent of locations will also provide that capability for complex elevational data for terrestrial species. Important trait data will also be incorporated. For the first time, molluscan occurrence data will distinguish between live- and dead-collected specimens, with a defined vocabulary for traits added to each record. Due to the long persistence of molluscan shells, the live/dead- collected distinction is crucial for all studies of biotic change using mollusks. Information on collecting dates will be refined where possible to increase resolution for detecting biotic changes. The data will be shared through public data repositories, including iDigBio, GBIF, OBIS, and the InvertEBase Symbiota portal.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001036.xml,Rubbing-Induced Site-Selective Patterning for Two-Dimensional Dichalcogenide Devices,NSF,2020-07-01,2024-06-30,405869,"This grant supports research that advances critical knowledge for manufacturing electronic devices based on emerging nanomaterials, helping advance U.S. industrial competitiveness and national prosperity. Two-dimensional nanomaterials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides, could be exploited to make a broad range of electronic and photonic devices with superior functionalities. For example, dichalcogenides such as molybdenum disulfide, can be used to make flexible and wearable devices, biosensors for rapid illness diagnosis, and energy-efficient photodetectors. Although prototypes of these dichalcogenide devices have been demonstrated in the laboratory, the device community still lacks suitable technologies for realizing scalable nanomanufacturing of such devices. One of the most critical challenges is the vulnerability of dichalcogenides to the existing lithography and etching processes for manufacturing electronic devices. This award supports fundamental research to explore imperative knowledge supporting a new manufacturing technology involving site-selective patterning that enables reliable production of dichalcogenide device structures without involving processes that are detrimental to dichalcogenides. The high-quality dichalcogenide device structures produced by this technology are highly desirable for device applications in electronic, sensor, energy storage, and optoelectronic industries. This research enhances participation of underrepresented groups in the education activities related to advanced manufacturing.  <br/><br/>The new manufacturing technology, termed rubbing-induced site-selective (RISS) patterning, involves a controllable rubbing process for generating nano- or microscale triboelectric charge patterns on a substrate and a subsequent two-dimensional nanomaterial chemical vapor deposition process. The triboelectric charge patterns modulate the nucleation of material deposition precursors on the target substrate and enables direct formation of dichalcogenide device patterns at designated site-selective locations without the need for additional resist-based lithography and plasma etching, which can introduce irreversible contamination and damage to the dichalcogenide layered structure. However, scientific questions need to be answered to make RISS technology practical for manufacturing commercially viable dichalcogenide devices. This research is to understand the mechanisms related to the generation and control of triboelectric charge patterns as well as material deposition processes modulated by electric fields. The research team plans to establish a theoretical-experimental integrated methodology for designing rubbing templates, which can generate high-contrast triboelectric charge patterns under designated mechanical conditions. The research approach is to fabricate rationally designed rubbing templates using focused ion beam and atomic force microscope lithography techniques, experimentally identify mechanical conditions that generate high-contrast triboelectric charge patterns, perform modeling of material diffusion guided by triboelectric field and demonstrate production of arrays of dichalcogenide-based memristive devices for neuromorphic computing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000774.xml,Developing a Highly Capable Biomanufacturing Technical Workforce in South Texas,NSF,2020-06-01,2025-05-31,394859,"The growth of Texas companies that manufacture biological products on a contract basis has created a local and regional workforce need.  This project proposes to serve this growing biopharmaceutical manufacturing industry by developing an advanced biomanufacturing certificate and educating a skilled and diverse biomanufacturing technical workforce. The new certificate will be designed to incorporate interactive and inquiry-based laboratory learning and to provide students with real world experience with biotechnical/biomanufacturing equipment.  The project will also implement new strategies for recruitment and retention and provide educators with professional development relevant to the new certificate. The certificate is expected to serve two-year college students and high school students, as well as impact university faculty and industry partners. The project aims to provide equitable access to successful biomanufacturing careers for under-represented groups, including students who are women, Hispanic, and/or first-generation college students.<br/><br/>This project involves a collaboration between Del Mar College and Texas A & M University.  The technical merit of the project includes building upon and incorporating hands-on, instructor-led training modules covering bioprocess operations, upstream and downstream manufacturing of biologics, vaccines, quality control systems, and regulatory compliance.

2002589.xml,Collaborative Research: Leveraging Massive Smartphone Location Data to Improve Understanding and Prediction of Behavior in Hurricanes,NSF,2020-09-01,2024-08-31,346037,"In this project, newly available anonymous smartphone location data will be used to dramatically improve understanding of how households behave during hurricanes (e.g., how many people will evacuate, when, how, from where, and to where). Although previous research has provided valuable knowledge about population behavior in hurricanes, important gaps remain. Available models have limited ability to predict behavior in future hurricanes. Differences in behavior across different types of households and people, such as tourists or people without vehicles, are not well known. Neither are the sequence and timing of events that unfold for individuals over the duration of a hurricane. These gaps are largely due to limitations in the traditional types of data that have supported past research—surveys, interviews, and focus groups. This project will promote the science of modeling evacuation behavior by capitalizing on the availability of a new type of data— anonymous location information from smartphones—to make a leap forward in understanding and predicting the behavior of the population during hurricane evacuations. The project will advance national welfare and benefit society by substantially improving the ability to manage future evacuations. During a hurricane, officials make many highly consequential decisions, including issuing official evacuation orders, messaging the public, opening shelters, staging materials and staff, implementing special traffic plans, executing support for vehicle-less populations, and preparing to undertake rescues. All of these depend directly on how many people are expected to evacuate, when, how, from where, and to where. By providing a more accurate and nuanced prediction of population behavior during hurricanes, this project will enable officials to make those decisions in a more informed and effective way. To ensure findings will be translated to practice quickly and effectively, the research has been designed so that it can be integrated into the current decision-making tools and processes used by emergency managers. Our practitioner partners from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Florida and North Carolina state emergency management agencies will also help us share findings with the larger emergency management community. This study will facilitate the development of a procedure to acquire and analyze, in real time, similar data for other evacuation events.<br/><br/>Availability of new smartphone location data offers a rare opportunity to transform the study of population behavior in hurricanes. The data offers many benefits, including samples that are orders of magnitude larger than previously typical; offering cohesive timelines of individual behavior; providing direct observations not subject to recall or reporting bias; being available within 24 hours of movement; and being available at low cost in consistent form for many hurricanes. Combining the power of the new data with domain expertise based on traditional survey and interview data will advance the science in this area in five ways. First, we will improve knowledge by testing hypotheses from the traditional literature using a larger, independent dataset and new hypotheses not easily testable in the past. Second, multiple events may happen during the course of a hurricane, including hurricane-related events (e.g., hurricane turns, intensifies), official actions (e.g., issue official orders, close schools), and personal events (e.g., released from work). Each person experiences some or all of these events in a sequence over a hurricane’s duration. We will use sequential pattern mining to describe key observable events and actions, their possible sequences, the probabilities of different sequences, and duration distributions of each event. This modeling of the sequence and timing of events for individuals, which has not been done before, will illuminate the range of ways hurricane behavior, official actions, personal decisions, and time markers interact and unfold, and help identify promising points of intervention for evacuation support. Third, we will develop new statistical models to predict the probability a person will evacuate at each time period and go to a particular geographic destination as a function of attributes of the individual/household, official events, hurricane, forecast, time markers, and past actions since the hurricane formed. These models will offer improved out-of-sample predictive power by identifying influences on behavior that are not observable with small datasets; by improving the ability to predict geographic destination, which is important for estimating clearance times; and by, for the first time, taking advantage of observations of behavior early in the event that may be leading indicators of final behavior. Fourth, we will test the route choice assumptions implicit in traffic models used to predict clearance times, and determine the effects of road closures on traffic patterns during evacuation and reentry. The new data will allow testing that is more detailed and comprehensive than previously possible through isolated traffic counts and surveys. Finally, we will identify new behaviors and questions for future traditional research using a general inductive approach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000850.xml,CSEDI Collaborative Research: Understanding what we see in the lower mantle - mineral physics interpretation of seismic tomographic images,NSF,2020-07-15,2024-06-30,745000,"Earth’s mantle thermal convection drives plate tectonics. It is at the origin of numerous risks for populations (e.g., earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis). This process extracts Earth’s internal heat, notably produced by the crystallization of its core.  The core is ~3,500 km (~2,200 mi) in radius and consists mostly of iron with some nickel.  Its liquid outer shell, the outer core, generates the Earth’s magnetic field. Above the core lies the rocky mantle, a hot layer of mostly solid silicates wrapped into the planet’s crust.  The core-mantle boundary (CMB) is located ~2,900 km (1800 mi) beneath the Earth’s surface. It is a complex and critical boundary. There, heat transfer, from the core to the mantle, constrains the geodynamo and powers mantle convection. Deep patterns of mantle flow are observed by refined seismic imaging above the CMB. These structures still challenge interpretations in terms of mineralogy and thermodynamical state. Here, researchers focus on the mantle system. The multidisciplinary team of computational scientists consists of a mineral physicist, two seismologists, an applied mathematician, and a geodynamicist. It introduces innovative approaches to analyze the origin of mantle structures, including machine learning algorithm. The models are constrained with the latest mineral physics data, obtained at the extreme pressures and temperatures prevailing in Earth’s interior. Gradually, the scientists unveil the origins, compositions, and temperatures of the deep mantle structures. Outcomes of the project, i.e., state-of-the-art methods, software, and databases, will benefit the Earth Science community. The project also provides support for an early career female scientist, and training for four graduate students at Columbia University and Princeton University.<br/><br/>Here, the researchers use the latest shear (S-) and compressional (P-) wave models obtained by global adjoint tomography, without reference to a 1D spherical model or assumptions of correlations between compressional (VP) and shear velocity (VS) heterogeneities. They also use direct inversion, machine learning algorithms, and the latest mineral physics results on thermoelastic properties of mineral phases undergoing iron spin crossover (ISC). They pay particular attention to the effect of the ISC which disrupts the usual correlation between VS and VP heterogeneities caused by lateral temperature or composition variations. They focus on lower mantle structures, mainly plumes rooted at the CMB and possibly slabs in this region. In the process, they are formatting the mineral physics data on ISCs to make it available through two popular thermochemical and thermoelasticity software/database frameworks – BurnMan and Perple_X – that couple with geodynamic codes. With this software/data infrastructure in place, they run geodynamic simulations to understand the effect of ISC on mantle dynamics. Conversely, results of geodynamic modeling coupled to thermoelasticity data are used to synthesize tomographic images to be compared with observed mantle structures. The know-how generated by this project, i.e., methods, software, databases, and results will be made available through peer-reviewed journals and in specialized web sites, e.g., BurnMan, Perple_X, IRIS, github.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000189.xml,Teachers as learners of equitable discussion practices,NSF,2020-07-01,2025-06-30,2498566,"Growing evidence about the powerful effects of skillful teaching on students’ learning creates a need for professional development that impacts teachers’ actual practice. Teaching practices have been shown to play a crucial role in the reproduction or disruption of injustice. This project aims to create opportunities for teachers to notice and understand how normalized practice often reproduces inequity and learn ways to disrupt typical patterns of inequity in their classroom. The project will design and study professional development that works on practice centered on the disruption of patterns of injustice. This project focuses on classroom discussions because they can be a key site for either reproducing or disrupting inequities and they have been established as a powerful instructional practice. In addition to studying the impact of the professional development on teachers’ teaching skill, the project also explores teachers’ perceptions of their learning, influences on teachers’ professional learning, and the impact of a mathematics-focused professional development versus a generalized focus on teaching practice and perception of learning. The project will generate new knowledge regarding ways in which elementary mathematics teachers can be supported to learn effective teaching practices. <br/><br/>Teachers benefit from professional development that addresses both the technical and contextual aspects of teaching practice, including the identities of their students and associated patterns of inequity in schools and society. This research will examine how elementary teachers’ perceptions of professional learning and influences on such learning in combination with professional development on leading discussions, impact their skill with and willingness to take up teaching that disrupts patterns of inequity in classrooms. In terms of influences on teachers’ professional learning, the project will address teachers’ beliefs about students and learning, their understanding of the pervasiveness of inequity in normalized practice, contextual factors such as their relationship with administration or their status in the school community, and their readiness for, skill with, and implementation of the practice upon beginning the professional learning. The studies will examine: (1) What are teachers’ perceptions of their own learning, discussion-leading practice, and attention to disrupting inequity? How well matched are these perceptions with external measures? What supports do teachers perceive as impacting their learning? How does principal selection criteria and communication with teachers about their selection impact teachers’ perceptions and engagement? (2) In what ways does professional development on leading discussions combined with peer and coach support impact teachers’ skill and willingness to engage in that teaching practice including disrupting patterns of inequity? (3) Does a mathematics focus produce different outcomes than a generalized focus for teaching practice or perception of learning? The project will collect and analyze several types of data, including measures of skill with leading mathematics and literacy discussions, teacher perceptions, and willingness and skill with disrupting patterns of inequity during discussions. This project will contribute foundational knowledge and theory related to (a) teachers’ perceptions of and influences on their learning to lead discussions with attention to disrupting inequity, (b) components of professional development that impact teaching practice, and c) how subject matter specificity effects these first two areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001272.xml,Whittaker Models and p-Adic Deformation in the Langlands Program,NSF,2020-08-01,2022-08-31,95375,"Primes numbers are integers, or whole numbers, which cannot be factored into a product of smaller integers. When considered as parts of larger and more abstract number systems, for example those containing imaginary numbers, there are several ways primes may factor. The splitting behavior of prime numbers is a fascinating and mysterious part of nature, and number theory is concerned with studying it systematically, especially by connecting it with the arithmetic of polynomials and the geometry of their solution sets. Over the past several decades, the Langlands program has revealed striking connections between these solution sets of polynomials and sets of symmetries that naturally occur in infinite-dimensional spaces. It has been especially fruitful in the Langlands program to consider the way these symmetries deform within families, and this project approaches two outstanding problems in this area by using the framework of Whittaker models to make them more concrete, or to turn them into explicit computational problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spaces of Whittaker functions of automorphic forms are called Whittaker models. Symmetries in Whittaker models capture what is needed to construct L-functions in the Langlands program, in many cases. This project will study the deformation theory of Whittaker models in order to understand the behavior of Langlands reciprocity with respect to congruences modulo prime numbers, and with respect to deformation in families. The first goal is to generalize Ihara’s lemma by controlling congruences between automorphic forms in terms of their local Whittaker models. The approach is to use a computer to test, in many examples, the congruences that can occur in the action of the local Iwahori-Hecke algebra on a non-Eisenstein integral eigenform. The second goal is to formulate, and prove in the banal case, a local Langlands conjecture in families for reductive groups other than the general linear group, especially quasi-split groups that split over a tame extension. The approach is to construct a moduli space of Langlands parameters, study its geometry, and use converse theorems to connect it to the integral Bernstein center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These are very special types of functions, which package a lot of information and symmetry, and for this reason are the key to solving a myriad of mathematical problems. The project will reveal new symmetries possessed by L-functions, which in turn will be useful for understanding objects such as the prime numbers. Prime numbers are essential in cryptography, a method by which computer data is securely transferred. The project will also reveal how automorphic forms are distributed. This will partially answer some open questions in Arithmetic Quantum Chaos, a multidisciplinary field at the interface of number theory and theoretical physics. The project will provide research training opportunities for graduate students. The principal investigator will also continue to be involved in an outreach program to prepare underprivileged high school students for college entrance.<br/><br/>In more detail, the principal goals of this project are to: 1) Make progress towards the Random Wave Conjecture, which predicts that automorphic forms should behave like random waves and 2) investigate the class of reciprocity formulae for L-functions. The Random Wave Conjecture can be formulated in terms of moments of automorphic forms, with the statement for the second moment corresponding to the familiar Quantum Unique Ergodicity problem. This project will go beyond QUE, by investigating higher moments of automorphic forms, and yielding a finer understanding of the distribution of automorphic forms. The reciprocity formulae are certain exact formulae for moments of L-functions, exhibiting some surprising symmetry. An early example is Motohashi's formula, which relates the fourth moment of the Riemann Zeta function to the third moment of automorphic forms. This project will discover new examples of reciprocity formulae, which will shed light on the nature of such symmetries and yield new applications, such as subconvexity bounds for L-functions. The unifying approach for both goals will be a study of moments of automorphic forms and L-functions, using methods from the analytic theory of L-functions and the spectral theory of automorphic forms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2002425.xml,Tracking Southern Ocean sea ice extent and frontal positions: Novel techniques based on oxygen isotope and Mg/Ca analyses of foraminifera,NSF,2020-06-01,2024-05-31,397311,"Understanding the drivers of glacial-interglacial carbon dioxide (CO2) cycles is one of the most important questions in the field of paleoclimatology.   It has long been known that Earth’s ice sheets expand when atmospheric CO2 is low and melt as CO2 rises, but the underlying climate mechanisms remain unclear.  Expanded sea ice coverage in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica may have limited the release of carbon from the deep ocean during natural cold periods such as the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; ~20,000 years ago).  Greater sea ice extent and northward movement of oceanic fronts may have also led to carbon storage in the deep ocean.  Reliable paleoclimate records from the Southern Ocean are thus essential to understanding the controls on atmospheric CO2 over long timescales. The proposed study will develop new methods to produce such records, using chemical analyses of microscopic fossils from marine sediment cores. The educational impact of the proposed work includes support for a graduate student and an undergraduate at the University of Connecticut.  <br/><br/>The proposed work will focus on developing a new proxy for sea ice extent based on the oxygen isotope ratios (d18O) of benthic and planktonic foraminifera. Sea ice formation in the Southern Ocean is characterized by near-freezing surface conditions and negative buoyancy forcing, which creates a unique vertical profile in d18O.  Preliminary data from the published literature shows that the d18O difference between recent planktonic and benthic foraminifera yields an estimate of sea ice extent consistent with modern observations.  We also plan to develop a novel proxy for subtropical front position based on foraminiferal magnesium/calcium (Mg/Ca) and d18O analyses. Contemporary measurements of sea-surface temperature and the d18O of seawater capture the position of the subtropical front, implying that reconstructions based on Mg/Ca and d18O can be used to track frontal position in the geologic past.   Motivated by these initial results, we propose to use a transect of cores from ~55ºS to 35ºS in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean to: 1) estimate sea ice extent and surface buoyancy forcing during the LGM, and 2) reconstruct the position of the subtropical front during the LGM to constrain inter-basin exchange between the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The proposed work could transform our understanding of the Southern Ocean by adding two new methods to the paleoclimate toolkit.  The d18O sea ice proxy will complement existing diatom-based methods and it can be used in regions where diatoms are sparse.  Similarly, development of the subtropical front technique will lay the groundwork for studies of the deglaciation when changes in frontal position have been invoked to explain rising atmospheric CO2.  Given the relevance of the techniques to research questions across a range of timescales, we anticipate our results will be of broad interest to the paleoclimate community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2002699.xml,A Dynamic Flash Evaporation and Vapor Separation System for Seawater Desalination,NSF,2020-08-01,2023-07-31,300000,"There is a worldwide scarcity of potable water. Desalination of abundantly available seawater especially in coastal areas offers a viable option for conversion of seawater into fresh water. A number of schemes for desalination of water in the past have been developed. However, these schemes are either energy intensive or capital intensive. As a result, the cost of production of potable water is relatively high. The project will develop, analyze, and optimize a novel high-throughput desalination technique that is compact, modular, and relatively inexpensive to build and operate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this technique solar-heated sea water from a solar pond flows through a set of injector passages, where the water becomes superheated leading to formation of vapor bubbles. Formation of bubbles accelerates the pressure drop allowing more thermal energy to be converted into vapor. The vapor-liquid mixture exits the injector passages into a larger tube tangentially. Centrifugal force generated as a result of swirl causes liquid to move outward while vapor forms a core in the middle of the separator tube. Vapor leaves the vapor core via a retrieval tube to a condenser to create potable water. Separated liquid is pumped back to the solar pond to be reheated. Having demonstrated the viability of the concept in the laboratory, the team is proposing to expand the experimental work to demonstrate the applicability of the concept over a broad range of operational parameters. Data for thermal conversion efficiency, vapor separation effectiveness and temperature and pressure profiles in the injector passages and separator tube are to be obtained. The data will be used to support analytical and numerical modeling of the process. Void fraction in the separator tube is to be measured and stability of vapor core in the separator tube will be investigated under a variety of mass and momentum flux conditions. This is an area unexplored before and represents a significant intellectual challenge with respect to meaningful experiments and analytical/numerical modeling. Gained knowledge will be used to optimize thermal conversion efficiency and vapor separation effectiveness under a range of flow conditions and temperatures of water exiting the solar pond. Lastly experimental effort will be used to develop an operational map that could be of great value for practical implementation of this novel concept at atmospheric and sub-atmospheric pressures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Healthy cells monitor their neighbors and induce sick cells to undergo cell death, followed by compensating growth and division of the healthy cells, so that the tissue keeps the same number of cells and all the cells are healthy.  These studies will provide new insight into how the fine control of this process occurs to repair damaged tissues, and how it changes in aging tissues.

These activities will promote the participation of underrepresented groups and have a broad impact on society at large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In their recent studies, the PI and colleagues found that, in post-mitotic Drosophila follicular epithelia, normal cells play an active role in eliminating aberrant but viable neighbors through JNK-dependent ""cell competition,"" and undergo sporadic cellular hypertrophy to repair the tissue.  This ""compensatory cellular hypertrophy"" (CCH) is probably a general cellular mechanism for post-mitotic tissue homeostasis, as it is also induced when some cells in the post-mitotic follicular epithelium fail to grow to their full size.  The PI and colleagues further found that CCH is induced by hyperactivation of insulin- or IGF (insulin-like growth factor)-like signaling (IIS) in hypertrophic cells.  In the proposed study, they will determine the mechanisms underlying post-mitotic cell competition and CCH processes. This research will address the following specific aims: (1) To reveal the mechanisms underlying loser cell elimination in post-mitotic cell competition.  Under this aim, crucial questions such as how JNK signaling is activated in winner cells neighboring loser cells, and how this pathway executes its effect to eliminate loser cells via apoptosis, will be addressed. (2) To determine the mechanisms by which loss of local tissue volume induces CCH.  This aim focuses on how changes in local tissue volume are translated into IIS signaling activation in certain winner cells, and how cellular hypertrophy is regulated. They will test the hypothesis that homeostatic CCH is induced by tensile forces caused by loss of local tissue volume."

Nitric oxide (NO) is a very important molecule in human physiology. It is, for example, a key immune defense agent released by cells from the immune system in response to encounters with bacteria that cause diseases. However, pathogenic bacteria have evolved defenses against NO.  These bacteria use enzymes called flavodiiron NO reductases (FNORs) to efficiently remove NO by transforming it into the less toxic molecule N2O. As a result, harmful bacteria can proliferate in the human body and can cause hard to cure infections. The research in Dr. Lehnert’s laboratory contributes to the elucidation of the mechanism of catalytic reactions by which FNORs break down NO by using molecules that mimic the active site of FNORs. Understanding the chemistry of FNORs can accelerate finding new cures against bacterial infections, in particular those caused by drug-resistant strains. The graduate and undergraduate students who do the research acquire knowledge and skills in advanced chemical synthesis, analytical and advanced spectroscopic methods, and become versed in how to approach and solve scientific problems. These skills help the students to successfully compete in the job market. Finally, outreach with Cass Technical High School in Detroit is integrated in this project. Here, underrepresented minority high school students participate in real research in the Lehnert laboratory over the summer.<br/><br/>This research project is aimed at using model complexes to gain insight in the active site of flavodiiron nitric oxide reductases (FNORs).  The focus is on the elucidation of the structural and electronic properties of the diiron active sites of the enzymes that influence the catalysis of the NO reduction to N2O. In previous work, Dr. Lehnert has synthesized model complexes that represent all three mechanistic possibilities of how FNORs could bind and activate NO. Next generation model systems are developed to investigate how the redox potential and the second coordination sphere of the diiron core of these enzymes affects the reactivity of the enzyme, and to determine the mechanism by which NO is bound and activated. According to DFT calculations, the key intermediate following N-N bond formation in FNORs is hyponitrite, but so far, researchers have not been able to trap these (or any) intermediates of the reaction. Here, model complexes are used to investigate the coordination chemistry of hyponitrite with non-heme iron centers and to establish relationships between the hyponitrite binding mode and the ability of the iron complexes to mediate N2O generation. Finally, previous work has shown that non-heme iron sites can form NO complexes in three different oxidation states, FeII/III/IV-NO(-). The corresponding FeIV-NO(-) species have recently been invoked as intermediates in biosynthetic pathways for natural products that contain the N-nitroso group. Dr. Lehnert uses the only known model complex for this species to investigate the biologically-relevant reactivity of FeIV-NO type intermediates in N-N bond forming reactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is expected that the award will (1) further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, (2) improve research and teaching at the home institution, and (3) engage more undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in research experiences. The project from Texas Southern University, a Historically Black College/University (HBCU), seeks to study the non-apoptotic functions of the Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) protein in osteosarcoma (OS) biology.  The specific objectives include the investigation of (1) the mechanism of action responsible for death ligand-induced cell death; and (2) the role of FADD in cellular homeostatic activities.  The project includes mentoring two Texas Southern University undergraduate students in research experience. <br/><br/>Fas-associated protein with death domain was initially discovered as an adaptor protein that facilitates Fas-mediated apoptosis. Subsequent studies reported non-apoptotic functions of FADD in immune cells. Non-apoptotic functions of FADD have not been extensively studied in cancer, and no reports are available on non-apoptotic functions of FADD in osteosarcoma (OS). Osteosarcoma is the most common type of bone cancer found in children and teens. The Principle Investigator has previously reported that decreased FADD expression sensitizes OS to death ligand-induced cell death, indicating that FADD protects OS against death ligand-induced cell death. The aim of this study is to investigate the non-apoptotic functions of FADD as well as the signaling pathways associated with the non-apoptotic functions of FADD in cancer, specifically OS. The specific objectives of this research are: 1) to determine the mechanism of action responsible for death ligand-induced cell death in OS with altered FADD status and 2) to elucidate the function of FADD in cell homeostasis to include regulation of oxidative stress, cell proliferation and regulation of cell cycle. Level of FADD expression, cellular localization of FADD and FADD phosphorylation affects FADD function. To investigate the non-apoptotic functions of FADD, three OS cell models will be used: 1) cells with reduced expression of FADD, 2) cells with impaired nuclear localization of FADD, and 3) cells with inhibited FADD phosphorylation. The experimental approach presented investigates the different cellular states of FADD that affect FADD function. Assessment of pro-survival and pro-death signaling pathways and expression of pro-survival and pro-death molecules will elucidate mechanisms responsible for death ligand-induced cell death in OS with altered FADD status. Cell growth, cell viability, metabolic activity, and cell cycle regulation in the three OS cell models will be assessed to determine the impact of altered FADD status on cell homeostasis. The results generated from this investigation will contribute to a better understanding of FADD function in OS and will serve as a basis for the direction of research on the biological function of FADD in other cancers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With input from the advisory board and local industry surveys, the project has identified needed technical skills. These skills, such as micropipetting, DNA and protein extraction and purification, and enzyme-linked immunoassay, will be the foundation of the modules and badges. The lab modules will become part of each course, thereby ensuring that all students develop biotechnology skills. Although the badges will not be required, they will be strongly recommended, especially for students considering temporary or career-long work as technicians in the local workforce. Badging will support many students by providing a pathway of incremental and achievable steps embedded in course completion. Pairing badges with in-class career-development activities and providing industry examples (through speaker series and other events) will provide a new, clear career pathway into biotechnology within the existing biology major. In addition to developing the labs and badges, the project will support technician-level biotechnology education with targeted recruiting at the college and the local high schools, and by collaborating with employers to secure paid internships and job placements. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001042.xml,"Quantitative, Computational, and Stochastic Aspects of Topology",NSF,2019-08-01,2022-07-31,174244,"Topology is the study of global properties of geometric objects which are preserved under deformation; it has recently found applications in areas such as protein folding and analysis of high-dimensional data. A particularly successful approach, which has produced innumerable results since the 1950's, is computing algebraic invariants which are then studied through algebraic means.  However, in many situations this way of transforming the problem hides some inherent geometric complexity -- for example, one can deform one object to another, but only by making it very complicated somewhere in the middle.  In such a case, the existence of a deformation may not be particularly meaningful from a physical, application-oriented point of view.  In other cases, in contrast, one can always find a reasonably straightforward deformation, validating the use of algebraic methods for applications.  The purpose of this project is to investigate these phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will enrich our understanding of the ideas of geometric topology by proving results of three types: quantitative results, measuring the size and complexity, in various senses, of objects whose existence is known via algebra; algorithmic results, showing that certain problems can be resolved algorithmically while others cannot; and stochastic results, describing the properties of random objects. One can think of many such results as answering questions about the geometry of function and moduli spaces. Closely related questions are studied in geometric group theory, knot theory, the combinatorics of expander graphs, and the theory of topological data analysis. However, the study of high-dimensional and simply connected manifolds and complexes requires a different set of tools which have only begun to be developed. Since function spaces are found  all over mathematics, this project offers connections to a number of mathematical fields ranging from theoretical computer science to fluid dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2003312.xml,Subgrains and Dynamic Grain Growth in BCC Metals,NSF,2020-06-01,2024-12-31,429710,"Non-Technical Summary<br/>Metals and their alloys provide the load-bearing structures needed in sophisticated machines that support our modern society.  Useful applications range from aircraft to automobiles to bridges.  These structural materials are composed of microscopic crystals called grains.  The sizes, shapes, and orientations of grains control a material's mechanical properties, such as strength and ductility.  These microscopic features, part of the material microstructure, are determined by the manufacturing processes that produce and shape materials into useful machine components.  Manufacturing frequently requires deformation at elevated temperatures, the modern equivalent of hot forging by the ancient blacksmith, to control the material microstructure and final component shape.  During hot deformation, grains change size and shape in ways that we cannot yet predict or fully explain.  This project addresses the fundamental science behind the changes in grain shape, size, and orientation during hot deformation.  The goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms responsible for these changes.  Through this scientific understanding, opportunities are sought to: 1. improve material performance and 2. identify manufacturing methods that create improved material microstructures.  Both graduate and undergraduate students are educated and trained through experimental research.  Primary-school teachers are provided summer research experience, training, and resources to bring to their classrooms.<br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/>Dynamic grain growth involves changes in grain shape, size, and orientation during deformation at elevated temperatures.  It is critically important to the processing of many technologically useful metals and alloys.  However, the mechanisms that cause it are not yet understood.  This experimental study assesses the leading hypothesis among several proposed for mechanisms that control dynamic grain growth.  The hypothesized mechanism of subgrains driving high-angle grain boundary migration is investigated for (mechanically) steady-state plastic deformation of body-centered-cubic metals at elevated temperatures.  The goal of this study is to characterize and quantitatively measure the effects of subgrain interactions with high-angle boundaries during both dynamic normal grain growth and dynamic abnormal grain growth.  Recent advances in high-resolution analysis of electron back-scattered diffraction data are leveraged to provide quantitative characterization of subgrain interactions with grain boundaries.  An improved understanding of dynamic grain growth will provide capabilities for predicting and controlling material microstructures during hot deformation processing.  This will benefit manufacturing and domestic competitiveness.  Integrated with the proposed research are training and educational activities for both graduate and undergraduate students. Outreach involves primary-school teachers participating in a summer program of research experience and curriculum development to positively impact their own students.  This outreach focuses on imparting an accessible understanding of materials through hands-on projects and examples that utilize the aesthetic beauty of microstructure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Establishing such a connection will greatly advance our understanding of both subjects, and provide novel tools for studying two-dimensional CFTs. In implementing this project, new research opportunities will be created for undergraduates and early graduate students. These research opportunities will be supported by grant funding. The PI will also provide direct support for preexisting programs which seek to increase access to mathematics among women and underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>In more detail, one component of the project is to find an equivalence of (ribbon tensor) categories between the representation category of the so-called triplet vertex algebra, and the representation category of small quantum SL(2).

A positive resolution to this conjecture will provide the first direct link between logarithmic CFTs and quantum groups, a phenomenon which should be endemic among the most fundamental classes of logarithmic CFTs.

Nature, unlike geometry class in high school, is not composed of smooth lines, planes, and spheres, but rather bumpy, wrinkled, jagged curves like DNA wrapped up in the cell, surfaces like a mountainous landscape, and volumes like the porous nature of soil in the water table. Fractional derivatives have been used to describe these geometries of nature, but no one has built such geometries from the ground up, element by element. Using textured thin magnetic films, the team will build such geometries as the basis for a new class of materials intermediate between order and disorder. These materials will control transport of information in the form of waves of magnetism, called spin waves, moving through our textured thin film slower (sub-diffusive) or faster (super-diffusive) than possible in simple geometries used up till now. Construction of this new artificial material will be the first experimental realization of a quantum fractional derivative, because spin waves follow the same equations as the wave physics of quantum mechanics, in this case the fractional Schrödinger equation, up till now a purely theoretical idea. A key facet of this work is cross-training of graduate students between theory and experiment, producing a more robust workforce that can work in multiple modalities to solve new problems not tractable otherwise. Fields in which the work force can excel with this knowledge include battery technology, based on porous, fractional materials; the spread of contaminants in soil and the water table; and vascular structures for transport in biological matter, including self-healing materials based on biological ideas.<br/> <br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Fractional derivatives describe the bumpy, wrinkled, and jagged geometries of nature, where an integer derivative leads to divergent results rendering traditional definition of a derivative inapplicable, due to a rapid increase in the tangent and curvature with decreasing “ruler size”. Such natural geometries in the quantum context have been theoretically described with the fractional Schrӧdinger equation but never experimentally studied. The team  will explore the fractional Schrӧdinger equation-governed fundamental physics in multi-scale materials that consist of magnetic thin film–based, spatially modulated magnonic crystals. They will design and measure tunable sub-diffusive and super-diffusive transport in this artificial lattice as clear evidence of fractional Schrӧdinger equation dynamics. The design builds on a new order-disorder lattice modulation axis, with an ordered lattice at one extreme and a disordered lattice giving rise to Anderson localization at the other. The project will provide a general basis for generating fractional partial differential equations, and lead to a deeper understanding of the present highly empirical approach to porous and other fractional media ranging from battery applications to biomimetic Murray materials to spread of contaminants in soil and the water table. The program will be carried out through tight, integral collaborations between Mingzhong Wu's experimental group at Colorado State University and Lincoln Carr's theoretical group at Colorado School of Mines. Working together as an integrated team encompassing experimental and theoretical condensed matter physics, they propose a multi-faceted approach to meet broader impact goals, centrally themed on blending experiment and theory to train our graduate and undergraduate student to become well-rounded scientists.<br/> <br/>This DMR grant supports research on fundamental understanding of quantum materials and especially exploring principles that cross-cuts many other condensed matter systems with funding from the Condensed Matter Physics (CMP) Program in the Division of Materials Research of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nanomaterials capable of serving as optical temperature sensors are uniquely suited for this task because they are able to operate in environments where contact thermometry cannot be implemented (e.g., cells and deep tissues). However, the vast majority of luminescent nanothermometers lack the required temperature sensitivity. New inorganic nanomaterials with temperature-dependent luminescence response will be discovered and developed in this research. Through a combination of synthesis and characterization studies the rules governing the temperature sensitivity of these phosphors are established. These rules are then used to design optical thermometers with targeted sensitivity within a given temperature window. In addition, this project provides opportunities for workforce development at both undergraduate and graduate levels and K-12 STEM outreach. Graduate and undergraduate students are trained in the synthesis and advanced characterization of luminescent nanomaterials. 6th through 9th grade students participating in the annual STEM Day hosted by Wayne State University are introduced to optical materials research through a hands-on activity based on photostimulable phosphors.<br/><br/>The research aims to develop an understanding of how to tune the temperature sensitivity of luminescent nanothermometers by rationally matching hosts and activators. The chemical and structural tunability of a novel family of host materials is exploited to this end. The project can be divided into three thrust areas. The first area involves synthesis of a series of inorganic nanocrystals that incorporate divalent and trivalent metal dopants as luminescent centers. To this end, colloidal synthetic routes to heterocationic and heteroanionic nanocrystals are developed. The second thrust focuses on ascertaining the placement of the luminescent centers in the nanocrystalline hosts. This task involves interrogating the atomic arrangement in multiple length scales using element-specific spectroscopic probes. Finally, in the third thrust, the temperature-dependent luminescence response of the nanocrystals is systematically probed using steady-state and time-dependent spectrofluorometry. Composition–structure–luminescence relationships are then derived to reveal the fundamental chemical and structural principles governing the temperature sensitivity of the nanothermometers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many analytical models have been proposed to understand human mobility based on mobility data. However, most of these data are proprietary and cannot be accessed by the research community at large. Fortunately, based on the latest expansion of urban infrastructures, such mobility data has been collected by city government agencies and some companies that are willing to share the data for social good. However, a key challenge is the privacy concern since such data usually have sensitive information and system design details for potential privacy and security issues. To address this issue, the project aims to generate realistic yet synthetic mobility data through machine learning based on the real mobility data analytics and then share these realistic synthetic data with the research community. The objective of the project is to lower the entry barriers for interdisciplinary researchers in mobility data-intensive research aimed at addressing major scientific/societal challenges related to urban mobility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core merit of the project lies in integrating two aims, i.e., privacy-preserving data synthesis and data integration, for large-scale smart city mobility research. For the first research aim, the project plans to utilize recent advances in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enable large-scale mobility data synthesis. The goal is to achieve the individual-level release of realistic synthetic mobility data by GAN-based models targeting key characteristics of human mobility. The GAN architecture proposed has novel technical components to augment basic GAN frameworks, which optimize the fundamental trade-off between privacy (regarding removing/obfuscating sensitive mobility features) and utility (in terms of preserving non-sensitive mobility features) with long-range dependencies (in terms of repeated mobility patterns) revealed. For the second research aim, the PIs plans to perform multi-modal data integration based on aligned multi-tensor decomposition under mobility semantics. The technical approach proposed is to enable multi-modal data integration based on synthetic single-modal data for comprehensive mobility modeling with a set of machine learning techniques including novel mobility semantic learning and multi-tensor decomposition with aligned spatiotemporal granularity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recently, this question has received attention in other contexts: when the spheres are considered in the realm of algebraic geometry, or when the spheres have specified symmetries which must be preserved by the mappings in question. More recently, greater understanding of how these various contexts impact each other has emerged.

Fractal spaces appear in description of many natural phenomena such as in lightning bolts, growth models of plants and crystals, snowflakes, coastlines, and river networks.

While in the case of ""smooth"" objects (objects that are not modeled using fractals) the corresponding mathematical theory is well understood, this is not the case for fractal objects, which require the development of new techniques. This project aims to develop mathematical theory for such fractal spaces. Another focus of this project is the study of removable fractal sets. Fractal sets appear sometimes as boundaries of otherwise ""smooth"" objects, and for many problems it is useful to know that these fractals are removable, in the sense that their presence can be ignored for some purposes. Removability of fractal sets has applications in mathematical problems that require ""gluing"" together two functions, or two dynamical systems, or two surfaces, and could result in the better understanding of dynamical systems in physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project consists of three parts, concerning the uniformization of Sierpinski carpets, the uniformization of two-dimensional metric surfaces, and the problem of removability of fractal sets for conformal maps. Continuing earlier work, the PI will study problems related to the uniformization of Sierpinski carpets by square Sierpinski carpets and the PI will study the regularity of the uniformizing map, which is already known to be quasisymmetric or discrete quasiconformal. The PI will also work in questions related to Hausdorff dimension distortion under the uniformizing map and in generalizations of this planar uniformization theory to abstract Sierpinski carpets. Another focus is the problem of uniformization of two-dimensional metric surfaces. In this direction, the PI will investigate possible generalizations of uniformization theorems for two-dimensional surfaces by Euclidean space and concentrate efforts on weakening the existing geometric assumptions. Finally, the PI will work on extending earlier results on the removability of fractal sets, by finding topological criteria for fractal sets (resembling the Sierpinski gasket or carpet) to be non-removable, studying the equivalence of Sobolev removability and conformal removability, and exploring the connections of removability to the problem of rigidity of circle domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is a subpopulation with high levels of religious adherence and low levels of higher education attainment.  The role of these students’ religious perspectives in influencing their higher education achievement has been largely overlooked yet may be a vitally important piece of understanding educational stratification in this subpopulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses existing national and local administrative data and further conducts semi-structured interviews to investigate behaviors and attitudes toward education, the relationship between religious affiliation and college pathways, and the influence of faith leaders.

2001280.xml,Relating Special Values of L-Functions with Orders of Tate-Shafarevich Groups,NSF,2020-07-15,2025-06-30,152976,"Finding rational numbers that solve a polynomial equation is harder than finding solutions that are real numbers. This is because the real numbers form a number system called a completion of the rational numbers, and the solutions in a completion can usually be found more easily. One may hope to find the hard rational number solutions by scrutinizing the easier solutions living in the completions, but there may be a discrepancy between these two types of solutions. One central object in number theory designed to measure such a discrepancy is the Tate-Shafarevich group, and this group is only understood in some special cases. Two central conjectures (the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture and the Bloch-Kato conjecture) relate sizes of Tate-Shafarevich groups to special values of an appropriate function. This project outlines some progress on these conjectures via a theory called Iwasawa theory. Another goal is to understand the interplay between the special values from the perspective of a modern form of analysis, called p-adic analysis, and use this interplay to give an easy explanation of complicated phenomena of certain crystalline representations.<br/><br/>The Iwasawa main conjecture for elliptic curves at supersingular primes was proved by Wan in the case in which the trace of Frobenius vanishes, and the PI in the general supersingular case. The plan is to extend this work to more general modular forms. One central idea in the supersingular case is the construction of two appropriate p-adic power series, which is known explicitly by work of Pollack when the Frobenius trace is zero. The PI will work with Otsuki to explicitly construct the appropriate pair of p-adic power series in more general cases by developing the analytic aspect of supersingular Iwasawa theory further. One goal of such an explicit construction is determining reductions of crystalline Galois representations, shedding light on some conjectures of Breuil which describe these reductions purely in terms of the Frobenius trace and its Hodge-Tate weight. Another goal is to establish asymptotic formulas for the size of the p-primary components of Tate-Shafarevich groups as defined by Bloch and Kato, generalizing work of Lei, Loeffler, and Zerbes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001369.xml,L-Functions and Geometric Methods in Langlands Duality,NSF,2020-07-01,2023-12-31,213645,"Although the ancient Greeks saw arithmetic -- what we now call number theory -- and geometry as two distinct sciences, with very different methods, contemporary mathematicians have understood for many years that they are really two aspects of a single science.  This science, whose ramifications extend throughout mathematics, and whose applications are manifest in every corner of modern physics, computer science, and even the most recent developments in statistics, is as old as civilization, but it also takes on a completely new character at least once per generation.  The current project is a study of Langlands duality, a synthesis of number theory and the geometry of symmetry that has been one of the most familiar names for this science for nearly two generations.   For most of this period, the emblem of this synthesis has been the theory of L-functions, a computable system for encoding properties in number theory and geometry that matches the two aspects of this common science.  More recently, new and sophisticated geometric techniques promise to reframe the synthesis from above, as part of a larger synthesis that ultimately extends to the most speculative ideas in mathematical physics.  The PI plans to revisit Langlands duality from this new geometric standpoint, and to understand the place of L-functions in this broader picture.<br/><br/>The project is a contribution to the arithmetic theory of automorphic forms, in the setting of the Langlands program, motivated in part by the geometric Langlands program. The specific goals of the present project are the study of the local Langlands correspondence, using trace formula methods, L-functions, and Galois theory to reduce the local Langlands correspondence to a conjecture on ""incorrigible"" representations; the study of derived aspects of the Langlands program, inspired by both in specific cases arising from coherent cohomology and in the development of a unified geometric framework for both Langlands reciprocity for cohomology of locally symmetric spaces and Venkatesh's conjectures on the actions of derived deformation rings on cohomology; the construction of p-adic square root L-functions in families, using the higher Hida theory introduced by Pilloni and Boxer; the completion of the proof of an automorphic version of Deligne's conjecture on special values of tensor product L-functions; and the development of a character theory for mod p representations of p-adic groups.  In connection with this project, the PI is actively collaborating with colleagues in France, Austria, Germany, England, and Spain, as well as in the United States and Canada.  The methods involved in the present project combine techniques from arithmetic geometry and automorphic forms, especially the trace formula, categorical representation theory, and the new methods developed by Venkatesh, Darmon, and Gaitsgory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002398.xml,Collaborative Research: Quantifying the sea-surface temperature pattern effect for Last Glacial Maximum and Pliocene constraints on climate sensitivity,NSF,2020-06-01,2024-05-31,122779,"Predictions of future climate change are based in part on changes seen in geological records of times with different climates. Such times include the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) 21 thousand years ago (a colder time with lower atmospheric carbon dioxide levels) and the Pliocene Epoch 5.3 to 2.6 million years ago (a warmer time with higher carbon dioxide). These periods can be used to estimate the sensitivity of climate to changes in greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. Those sensitivity estimates help predict the amount of global warming we should expect to see in response to future greenhouse gas emissions. However, recent work has shown that the climate’s sensitivity to greenhouse gases depends not only on the average surface temperature change but also on the geographic pattern of that change. Thus, use of geological paleoclimate records to estimate future warming must account for how the spatial pattern of temperature changes in the past differs from that expected in the future. This project will combine information from paleoclimate data and climate models to evaluate the spatial pattern of surface temperature changes during the LGM and Pliocene. It will then develop methods to account for temperature pattern differences when using data from these past periods to help estimate future global warming.<br/><br/>Earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is the change in average surface temperature associated with a doubling of the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (CO2) relative to the pre-industrial atmosphere. The ECS is set by the radiative feedbacks that link surface warming to changes in the amount of radiation leaving Earth’s atmosphere. Recent studies have shown that global radiative feedbacks depend on the spatial pattern of sea-surface temperature (SST). Estimates of ECS based on the proxy record of past climate changes – such as those during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and Pliocene –  have traditionally been based on global mean energy budget constraints and thus do not account for how SST patterns in those states may be different from those in the future. This research will use recently developed data assimilation techniques, combining information from climate models and proxies, to reconstruct gridded SST fields for the LGM and Pliocene that are dynamically consistent with available proxy data. These SST fields will then be compared against those projected by global climate models under CO2 forcing. The sensitivity of radiative feedbacks to differences between LGM / Pliocene and CO2-forced SST patterns will then be quantified using a suite of atmospheric general circulation models and Green’s functions that link warming patterns to radiative feedbacks. By producing estimates of LGM and Pliocene surface temperature patterns and quantifying the impact of temperature pattern differences on radiative feedbacks, this research will improve our understanding of ECS derived from those past climate states. This work will further facilitate researchers’ participation in activities aimed at introducing high school students to climate science, through Current Climate Science workshops for high school teachers facilitated by the University of Washington’s Program on Climate Change and through George Mason University’s Aspiring Scientists Summer Internship Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ply interfaces are known to play a crucial role in composite manufacturing. Movement of ply interfaces during curing can lead to manufacturing defects that affect the composite structure performance and have been a limiting factor in several applications, resulting in delays and redesigns of products like aircraft and civil infrastructure. This grant aims at understanding the evolution and movement of composite interfaces during their manufacturing through the development of a novel in-situ characterization approach using digital image correlation (DIC). In addition, nanoscale interfacial components such as zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires will be utilized to mechanically alter the interfacial behavior during curing. Multiscale computational modeling will complement experimental investigations. The outcome of this research will lead to novel diagnostics that reduce processing-induced defects and addresses the current manufacturing needs of the commercial and defense industries. The educational impacts of the project involve the development of a vertically integrated pathway for engaging students in materials engineering, all the way from K-12 to graduate school.<br/><br/>This research will elucidate the role of interfacial kinematics and energetics in the evolution of inter-ply interfaces in composite structures during manufacturing. The research team will develop a novel experimental method for in-situ characterization of surface and interface deformations during composite processing, utilizing a customized commercial composite autoclave with a digital image correlation system. The surface strain and displacement measurements will be combined with ex-situ X-ray tomography and thermal characterization to map the interfacial thermomechanical response as a function of design and processing parameters. Additionally, the interfacial behavior will be engineered through the rapid and controlled growth of ZnO nanowires on carbon fibers to create a nanoscale interfacial component that increases the fiber bending resistance and creates an interlocking effect at the interfaces to mitigate defects propagation. The experimental research will be complemented by molecular dynamics simulations of the sliding of amorphous polymer interfaces and mesoscale simulation of flow in porous media. This comprehensive approach of in-situ characterization, interface design, and modeling will lead to a fundamental understanding of the ply movement during composite manufacturing and development of methods to reduce the occurrence of processing-induced defects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001181.xml,Topological and Dynamical Phenomena in Condensed Matter Systems Detected by Quantum Entanglement,NSF,2021-01-01,2023-12-31,330000,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports theoretical research and education on novel properties of quantum materials and associated phenomena. It has been long recognized that quantum mechanics is essential to understand the basic properties of solids. Understanding the distinction between metals and insulators are one example. With recent advances in experimental techniques, a class of materials has emerged for which subtle quantum effects of the system of their many constituent electrons control macroscopic properties that are characteristic of materials.  <br/><br/>One example of quantum materials are superconductors. At sufficiently low temperature, a quantum mechanical state forms in which electrons behave collectively leading to conduction of electricity with zero resistance. More recently discovered, is another class of quantum materials that are insulators in their bulk but can support zero resistance conduction of electricity along their surfaces and edges. The metallic surface states in these materials, known as topological insulators, are a consequence of the mathematical structure of the wavefunction which describes the many electron quantum state. The field of mathematics known as topology which focuses on geometric properties of an object that are unchanged by deformations, provides useful ways to describe the structure of the wavefunctions of topological phases in quantum materials.  It has become clear that quantum materials can exhibit exotic and surprising properties that do not have a counterpart in ordinary materials. <br/><br/>Quantum materials can also host exotic quantum mechanical particles that have intrinsic properties that are quite different from free electrons which make them candidates for the implementation of quantum computers. <br/><br/>Novel quantum phenomena can also be found in systems far out of the tranquil state of equilibrium. For example, sufficiently complex quantum many-body systems can ""forget"" their initial quantum states. In these novel quantum condensed matter systems, quantum entanglement provides a conceptual foundation and tools to study many-body quantum systems. When particles are entangled quantum mechanically, they are connected in a way that affecting one particle will affect all the others, even though they may be separated by vast distances. <br/><br/>In this project, the PI aims to develop a deeper theoretical understanding of the properties, including nonequilibrium properties, and phenomena associated with quantum materials, particularly in materials with strongly interacting electrons using concepts such as quantum entanglement together along with others that are associated with the emerging field of quantum information theory. In particular, the PI will examine the nature of the intricate quantum entanglement characteristic of topological phases.  He will also investigate how quantum entanglement spreads and propagates in complex many-body quantum systems. A thorough understanding of these problems can pave the way to the discovery of new states of quantum matter and associated phenomena that form the foundations of the next generation of technologies based on quantum mechanics. <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports theoretical research and education with the aim to investigate quantum many-body systems that exhibit novel phenomena, focusing on their topological and far out-of-equilibrium properties. <br/><br/>The PI plans to develop a many-body framework to study topological phenomena both in and out of equilibrium, and the structure of multiparty quantum entanglement in topological phases of matter. In particular, the PI plans to construct many-body diagnostics for the topological properties of periodically driven quantum systems in the presence of time-reversal and other symmetries. The PI will seek universal descriptions of quantum information scrambling in complex quantum dynamics using various quantum entanglement measures. <br/><br/>To carry out the research, the PI will utilize quantum information theoretical concepts and tools that include quantum entanglement, the channel-state duality, and tensor-networks. The proposed research will lead to a deeper understanding of novel phenomena in quantum many-body systems. The knowledge gained contributes to the foundations of future technological innovations based on quantum mechanical effects.

Representation theory of groups and Lie algebras is a mathematical language for studying symmetries of different problems in natural sciences. In this project, the PI will study a certain modification of Lie algebras called Lie superalgebras. The term ""super"" means that in addition to the usual (even or ""bosonic"") symmetries we allow another kind: ""odd symmetries"", which behave in a certain sense ""like fermions."" Superalgebras are mathematical tools encoding the concept of supersymmetry developed in physics in the second half of the 20th century. The theory of symmetric monoidal (tensor) categories is an advanced framework in representation theory. Recent developments have uncovered deep connections between superalgebras and tensor categories. The PI  will study applications of these results that will shed new light on the theory of Lie superalgebras, and provide new tools and techniques for investigating supersymmetries. This research area has many open questions that are accessible accessible for beginning researchers and this proposal includes research projects to be undertaken by undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>This proposal was submitted in response to the Dear Colleague Letter NSF 17-120: Special Guidelines for Submitting Collaborative Proposals under National Science Foundation (NSF) and US-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF) Collaborative Research Opportunities, and the proposed research will be pursued in collaboration with an Israeli researcher. Three projects are proposed. In the first project, the PIs will describe the conditions under which a natural generalization of the Jacobson-Morozov lemma holds for supergroups (and Lie superalgebras). This will be done using the theory of semisimplifications of tensor categories, in the spirit of recent work of Etingof, Ostrik, Andre, and Kahn. The PIs will then investigate the case when the condition on the supergroup does not hold and develop an analogue of the notion of a reductive envelope for supergroups. The second project concerns symmetric monoidal functors between representations of different Lie superalgebras. The PIs will study compositions of such functors and endomorphisms of such compositions. The third project concerns the periplectic supergroup, which is an interesting superanalogue of the orthogonal group. The PIs will answer open questions about representations of the periplectic supergroups, such as computing dimensions and characters of irreducible representations, as well as use Duflo-Serganova functors to study stabilization patterns in periplectic representation theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001670.xml,Harnessing the Data Revolution in Space Physics: Topological Data Analysis and Deep Learning for Improved Solar Eruption Prediction,NSF,2020-04-01,2024-08-31,792387,"Eruptions generated by sunspots --- large concentrations of magnetic field on the visible surface of the Sun --- can have a number of dire impacts on Earth-based technological systems, crippling satellites and power grids, among many other things.  With enough advance notice, the effects of these events can be mitigated, but predicting them is a real challenge.  In current operational practice, this is accomplished by human forecasters examining images of the Sun, classifying each sunspot according to a taxonomy developed in the 1960s, and then using look-up tables of historical probabilities to say whether or not it will erupt in the next 24 hours.  Recently, there has been a burst of work on machine-learning methods to automate this task.  To date, the ""features"" used in these approaches have been predominately physics-based: the gradient of the magnetic field, for instance, or the sum of its strength over high-flux regions.  The main objective of this 3-year research project is to leverage algorithms based on the fundamental mathematics of shape --- topology and geometry --- to improve the performance of these methods.  The specific plan is to use these powerful techniques to extend the relevant feature set to include characteristics of the magnetic field that are based purely on the geometry and topology of 2D magnetogram images. Although this approach ignores the 3D structure of the full electromagnetic fields, it can enhance the predictive skill of machine learning systems.  Preliminary results show clear topological changes emerging in magnetograms of a 2017 sunspot more than 24 hours before it flared, as well as clear improvements in the accuracy scores of a neural-net based flare prediction method that employs these shape-based features.  Better predictions of solar flares could allow operators of power grids, airlines, communications satellites, and other critical infrastructure systems to mitigate the effects of these potentially destructive events.  The broader impacts of this project also include the development of the STEM workforce through the training of graduate students at the University of Colorado at Boulder, as well as education and outreach, including community lectures, development of large-scale, online courses and public lecture series.  The interdisciplinary nature of the project will deepen the contact between the fields of space weather, applied mathematics, and computer science, bringing researchers, students, and post-docs from both fields into productive new collaborations.  The collaboration with the Space Weather Technology, Research, and Education Center at the University of Colorado offers unique opportunities to factor in real-world forecasting constraints and set the stage for transitioning the results to operational status.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the first time, this 3-year research project would provide systematic quantitative measures of the shape of 2D magnetic structures in the Sun’s photosphere for the purposes of solar flare prediction.  In a sense, this amounts to a mathematical systemization of the venerable McIntosh and Hale classification systems.  This approach differs from current studies in the solar physics community that model the magnetic field-line structure: it uses topology to address the structure of two-dimensional sets.  The analysis is restricted to photospheric magnetic field structures; the goal is to extract a formal characterization of shape that can be leveraged by machine learning to improve flare prediction.  The considered addition of geometry into these methods by the project team is essential if they are to capture the full richness and physical relevance of the structures important in the evolution of a sunspot.  This research project will point the way forward to a more robust set of features for machine-learning-based eruption prediction architectures.

However, making the operations of these airborne platforms autonomous requires the execution of algorithms for the real-time analysis of the surrounding environment and mission planning. The complexity of these algorithms clashes with the inherent constraints of UAVs, whose embedded systems have limited computing power and energy supply. The proposed research aims at the development of techniques to make distributed computing ultra reliable in the context of UAV systems. The project establishes a layer of intelligence that controls in real-time how information is propagated and processed across the layers of the systems to transform sensorial input into decisions, as well as a semantic form of neural compression to significantly reduce the amount of data transported over weak wireless links.

The impact of this research effort will be broadened by providing unique outreach and educational opportunities to students at the collegiate and high school level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project approaches the problem from two complementary angles: (1) designing deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents that learn to optimally communicate data across noisy channels, and (2), building novel lossy compression algorithms based on probabilistic deep learning that are specifically designed for distributed machine learning without a human in the loop. For (1), one of the key challenges resides in the multi-scale nature of the stochastic processes driving the system dynamics that present important geographical and temporal trends at different scales. An innovative hierarchical learning approach will be used to make the RL agent effective as the system dynamics evolve across time and space. For (2), novel kinds of extreme neural lossy compression algorithms based on Variational AutoEncoders (VAE) with additional supervision will be designed. Instead of focusing on signal reconstruction, the resulting compressor will aim at preserving only relevant information needed for a specified supervised learning task, leading to the new paradigm of supervised (or semantic) compression.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Flexible electronics represents a manufacturing technology that builds circuits and devices on flexible polymer substrates. Flexible devices have applications in health monitoring, drug delivery, energy storage and personal entertainment, and has the potential to reshape human lifestyle. Nanomaterials have been enthusiastically embraced in flexible electronic manufacturing due to their outstanding functionalities and small size. However, the inherent size variation of nanomaterials presents a significant challenge for repeatable and reliable device manufacturing. Traditionally, a separate nanomaterial sorting process is required, which is not only costly but also slows down the manufacturing process. This award supports fundamental research to generate knowledge for the development of a highly efficient sorting-assembly manufacturing process that selectively assembles nanomaterials with similar sizes into nanostructures for flexible electronic and other devices. Importantly, the unique feature of utilizing low-cost raw nanomaterials with large size variations into high-quality device structures can lead to manufacturing of affordable flexible electronic devices. This research integrates nanomanufacturing, material science, and fluid mechanics. The knowledge gained is applied toward the education of underrepresented STEM students and the development of undergraduate and graduate manufacturing curricula, thus educating and training the future workforce in advanced manufacturing.  <br/><br/>This research combines a novel fluidic control mechanism with a weak sono-assisted assembly process that achieves assembly of nanomaterials, such as, zero-, one- and two-dimensional materials, with precisely controlled particle size and assembly rate.

2000417.xml,Collaborative Research: Defining and Measuring Student Trust of Instructors in College STEM Courses,NSF,2020-10-01,2024-09-30,381339,"This project aims to serve the national interest by conducting basic research to characterize key components of student trust in college STEM instructors and how that trust contributes to desired student outcomes.  The project is an EHR Core Research (ECR) Level 1 award, focused on STEM Learning and Learning Environments. A consensus is emerging about the benefits of student-centered pedagogies, like active learning, for students in college classrooms.  However, less is known about how psychological and social factors in a classroom affect student outcomes. Furthermore, psychosocial factors may be particularly important in innovative teaching contexts where students are learning in new, unfamiliar ways. This project targets the multidimensional psychosocial variable of trust. Most existing educational studies on trust focus on primary/secondary school contexts and examine trust indirectly through student-teacher interactions or through the teacher or organization, instead of the student. The limited previous efforts in college environments have examined whether college students perceive their relationship with their instructor as a trusting one, as defined by understanding, acceptance, and care. Such efforts showed that trust predicted student buy-in to course material, course engagement, final course grade, and intent to persist in science.  Interestingly, trust was more important in achieving these outcomes than other variables such as growth mindset. However, this previous definition of trust does not include other key dimensions of trust or the dynamics of trust-building. This project seeks to examine college students’ trust in their instructor by using a more comprehensive theoretical framework of trust. Utilizing this framework, trust building between students and instructors in college STEM courses will be facilitated, and the impact of trust on desired student outcomes will be assessed. It is anticipated that this work will advance research on student trust within the college STEM course environment, and examine how building trust positively impacts student engagement, learning, and persistence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research unifies theories from the education and psychology research literatures to define trust more fully in an undergraduate STEM course context. It seeks to address two important research questions: 1) What are the key dimensions of student trust of an instructor in large college STEM classrooms? and 2) How does student trust in the instructor relate to important student outcome variables (e.g., student commitment, engagement, intent to persist in STEM, and final course grade), and are there differential impacts for students from groups underrepresented in STEM fields as compared to other groups of students? This project targets large enrollment college STEM courses, not only because these courses are where most STEM students in the nation are taught (majors and non-majors alike), but also because large enrollment courses such as these can make it particularly challenging to develop “one-to-many” (i.e., “instructor-to-students”) trust relationships. To broadly define and measure trust, this research will be conducted in courses operating as traditional lectures as well as those using new, evidence-based teaching practices. This project intends to use a mixed methods approach for instructor and student data collection. Specifically, it will proceed through a process of taxonomy development, instrument construction, and instrument validation to create and iteratively improve a measure of student trust for use in higher education contexts. The expected result is the initial establishment of a comprehensive yet parsimonious measure of college students’ trust in their instructor. This project has the potential to serve the STEM education community’s ongoing emphasis on finding ways to increase students’ commitment and engagement in student-centered classrooms and in STEM majors more broadly.

The study promotes our understanding of how living cells can selectively retain and release their water content.  Such water controlling mechanisms are essential to understanding not only life's origins but also the functions of major organs such as the skin and kidneys. More broadly, the project has a potential to contribute to human health and clean water applications that rely on the retention and elimination of water and waste. The research enables training for a large number of undergraduate research participants in the project. The research team further broadens the impact of their work by developing outreach seminars and science symposia for high school students and teachers that inspire and engage students to enter science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, particularly those from underrepresented groups.  Professor Lee and her students travel to the University of Tokyo in Japan to conduct experiments on high-throughput device fabrication obtaining a global perspective on science. <br/><br/>This research is focused on elucidating how supramolecular self-assemblies at micron-sized liquid-liquid interfaces can serve as controllable barriers for the passage of water.  The team of researchers, Professor Lee and undergraduate students at Iona College, will investigate the directionality of the water movement, and balance between permeability and stability in protocell models through experimental activities strategized to determine the water permeability parameters and energy of activation for osmotic flow, electrical properties of capacitance and leakage current, diffusional water permeability, and adhesion energy.  Upon successful completion, this research could provide fundamental insights into how lipid asymmetry plays a role in organismal water homeostasis, and the balance between stability and permeability in prebiotic cellular models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One fruitful way in which manifolds can be studied is through their symmetries, which taken together form an algebraic object called a group. The focus of this project is the interaction between the structure of a manifold, both local (up close) and global (as an ensemble), and its symmetries, or group actions on manifolds for short. The project aims to resolve some basic questions in this area and investigate some new phenomena. Among the problems of particular interest are those concerning smoothness of group actions, in the sense of calculus. A resolution of some of these problems has the potential to yield insight into old open questions about exotic spheres, which are certain manifolds which can be deformed into standard spheres, but only in a highly singular way.  Groups acting on manifolds are a broad class of objects which have received a large amount of attention, and their theory has developed rapidly in recent years. Planned broader impacts include research experiences for undergraduates, conference organization, and a book on right-angled Artin groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to these advances in several ways. One area of focus for the project is critical regularity of group actions. Previous work with Kim will be extended in order to compute the critical regularity in one dimension of right-angled Artin groups, which would then be the first natural class of non-nilpotent groups whose precise one-dimensional critical regularity is both finite and known. Moreover, the principal investigator intends to develop critical regularity in higher dimensions, with the goal of encoding the diffeomorphism type of a compact manifold by a set of finitely generated groups. Such a result would give an algebraic approach to the 4-dimensional smooth Poincare conjecture. Another focus of the project is to develop a structure theory for thin subgroups of semisimple Lie groups, with the goal of resolving a conjecture of Shalom about the discreteness of their commensurators. The final main focus of the project is in the area of mapping class groups of surfaces, where the PI has outlined a program to prove the nonlinearity of mapping class groups, and to introduce logic into low dimensional topology by investigating the model theory of the curve graph of a surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When buildings are subjected to catastrophic events such as earthquakes, there is the need to assess their level of structural safety after the event. Structural assessment activities present two challenges - collecting high quality damage data and interpreting the acquired data in a meaningful and rational way - to produce estimates of the level of safety and residual strength of the inspected building. While advanced data acquisition systems are available to collect structural damage data, new methods are needed to analyze the collected data to assess structural performance.  This Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) will support a team of researchers from the University of Washington and the University of Nevada, Reno, to collaborate with researchers from Japanese universities on experimental research investigating the seismic performance of RC building systems.  The experimental research will involve the dynamic testing of a full-scale, three-story RC building as part of the ongoing Tokyo Metropolitan Resilience Project (TMRP) supported in Japan by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology and the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience. The experiments will be conducted at the world's largest shake table, E-Defense in Miki, Japan, in December 2019. The main goal of this RAPID project is to acquire, process, and analyze dynamic response and damage data pertaining to both structural and non-structural elements of the building. The data will be collected using equipment recently acquired by the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) RAPID Facility (https://rapid.designsafe-ci.org/) and the high-speed, high-resolution digital image correlation (DIC) integrated monitoring system recently developed at the University of Nevada, Reno. The processing and interpretation of this data will advance the state of knowledge and practice in post-earthquake structural assessments of buildings. The project will train two graduate students and several undergraduate students in structural integrity research and promote collaboration between Japanese and U.S. researchers. All collected data will be archived and made publicly available in the NSF-supported NHERI Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org/). Additionally, the results of this project will be disseminated via journal publications, conference presentations, a public webinar, and live broadcasts. This project contributes to NSF's role in the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this RAPID project, the Japanese and U.S. research team will investigate the seismic performance of a full-scale, three-story RC building system tested at the E-Defense shake table as part of the Japanese TMRP project.

To remain competitive, U.S. industries need to rapidly accelerate the use of intelligent robotics.  As a result, the nation needs to train highly skilled technicians who can program, use, maintain, and repair intelligent industrial robots. This collaborative project will address the nation’s shortfall of qualified technicians in intelligent industrial robotics.  It intends to do so by establishing a collaboration between academic institutions and major manufacturers in the eastern and central regions of Tennessee and Alabama. Together these partners will define the necessary skillset for the next-generation industrial robotics technical workforce.  They will also develop a curriculum that will allow students to learn those skills. This project will result in one of the first programs in the nation for workforce training in intelligent robotics and artificial intelligence technologies.  This effort will thus support U.S. businesses and industries to rapidly and effectively incorporate next-generation robotics in their workplace.<br/><br/>The project has the following specific aims:  1) develop intelligent robotics curricular modules; 2) implement train-the-trainer workshops for educators; 3) identify skill sets needed for handling the next-generation robotics; 4) develop a knowledge base of next-generation robotics for secondary and post-secondary educators; and 5) increase public awareness of next-generation robotics.  By using a collaboration among four academic institutions in the eastern and central regions of Tennessee and Alabama, and involving major manufacturers in the region, the project expects to deliver outcomes that will be sustainable and can be replicated or adapted at other institutions.  This project intends to develop one of the first programs in the nation for workforce training at community and technical colleges in intelligent robotics and artificial intelligence technologies.  Since community and technical college supply a significant percentage of the industrial workforce, this project has the potential to help U.S. businesses and industries rapidly and effectively incorporate next-generation robotics in their workplace.

In quantum mechanics, this information can be acquired by solving the Schroedinger Equation, which describes the properties of the physical system. This equation describes how protons and neutrons are confined inside a nucleus by the Strong Nuclear Force. This project will allow the development of sophisticated computer algorithms and programs in a parallel environment to solve the Schroedinger Equation for Helium-6 and Lithium-6 nuclei. These are each light nuclei consisting of six nucleons. The PI will mentor undergraduate STEM students at the Central State University (CSU), a historically black college. The students will gain practical skills in parallel programming and high-performance computing, while gaining confidence in using computational physics to study the structure of atomic nuclei. CSU students will learn the critical skills of computer programming and numerical methods by participating in this project, thereby increasing their qualifications for the STEM workforce or advanced degrees.<br/><br/>The Schroedinger Equation is often solved to benchmark and develop nucleon-nucleon interaction models in nuclear physics. Although the study of a six-nucleon bound state is computationally a challenging and expensive problem, its investigation provides insights into the rich structure of nuclear interactions. The main goal of this project is the numerical solution of the Schroedinger Equation in the Faddeev-Yakubovsky form in momentum space to calculate the six-nucleon binding energy and wave function. This project aims to implement the numerical solution of six-nucleon Yakubovsky equations in a partial wave decomposition by developing the relevant parallel computer algorithms and codes. This investigation will show how the full solution of coupled Faddeev-Yakubovsky integral equations in a complete six-body treatment can probe the modern two- and three-nucleon interactions. It also provides an in-depth insight into the halo structure of He-6 and also the ground state properties of Li-6. This project has potential broader impacts beyond nuclear physics.

It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improve research and teaching at the home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences. The award to Morehouse College has potential to broaden impacts in several areas. The goal of this project is to study programmed cell death in a model single organism. Comprehension of program cell death in this organism may serve as a model to dissect death pathways in higher organisms.  The proposed work will expose underrepresented minority students to cell biology, parasitology, molecular biology and bioinformatics.<br/><br/>Currently, we lack knowledge regarding the dedicated molecular pathways that coordinate programmed cellular death (PCD) in single-celled organisms. Of interest is apoptosis, a form of PCD characterized by several conserved features such as cell shrinkage, plasma membrane blebbing, and DNA fragmentation. The occurrence of apoptosis in single-celled organisms remains a debated issue, the resolution of which may have significant implications on our understanding of evolutionary processes. While studies have provided evidence of apoptosis in single-celled organisms, including Leishmania, it remains unclear whether apoptosis in Leishmania shares markers of apoptosis with those found in multicellular organisms, and if so, what mechanisms drive the process. The goal of the proposed study is to characterize apoptosis in Leishmania donovani to advance knowledge towards the identification and evaluation of proteins involved in apoptosis in L. donovani. Specifically, the research aims of this project are to: 1) evaluate the kinetics of apoptosis by examining morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis and 2) analyze gene expression in normal and apoptotic cell populations using RNA-Seq analysis. The proposed project may provide new insight into unicellular apoptosis with potentially novel transcriptional players that are distinct from (or perhaps distantly related to) apoptotic proteins in multicellular organisms.

Social psychological research has demonstrated the negative effects of perceived bias or becoming aware that one is the target of stereotyping and discrimination. This project will provide a novel contribution to and extension of the perceived bias research by proposing that simply witnessing instances of subtle gender bias can have differential effects on observers depending on whether they recognize the event as an instance of gender stereotyping. When witnesses observe stereotypic interactions but do not perceive them as instances of gender stereotyping, the interactions serve as a subtle stereotype cue that promotes stereotype-supporting outcomes. When witnesses to bias do recognize the stereotypic interactions as instances of gender stereotyping, the interactions serve as a blatant stereotype cue promoting stereotype-defying outcomes. The researchers will undertake a series of studies designed to experimentally test the effects of subtle vs. blatant stereotype activation (cued by witnessing bias on men and women in computer science and engineering contexts) focusing on performance, motivation, evaluation of peers, and group dynamics. The findings will inform ongoing and future intervention efforts aimed at raising awareness of and mitigating negative effects of gender bias in the STEM environment. The proposed project is a joint effort between the University of Michigan Ann Arbor and Michigan Technological University and is supported by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>This research effort will advance the discovery and understanding of mechanisms by which the presence of subtle gender bias influences the climate for men and women in STEM by specifically exploring process differences for blatant and implicit bias cues. The work will provide insight into the influences of these cues on performance and motivation among women, as well as the behaviors of men and women in groups and on teams. One strength of this work is the use of experimental methodology (i.e. randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to study the effects of witnessing subtle bias. Using RCTs provides a rigorous test of a causal relationship between exposure to subtle bias and its purported consequences. Moreover, this research project will also expand research and theory on the effects of experienced discrimination, by examining these effects on witnesses of bias, including men, with important downstream consequences. By exploring these relationships, the research will afford better understanding of how the awareness and attribution of subtle gender bias may modify outcomes for everyone in the setting. This understanding may inform ongoing and future intervention efforts aimed at raising awareness of and mitigating negative outcomes of gender bias in the STEM environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In places with high poverty levels, microlenders make small loans to nontraditional borrowers using more forgiving criteria than regular banks.  Policy analysts and donor organizations have portrayed microcredit as an inclusive solution to poverty.  The role of loan officers, however, who decide which applicants are approved or rejected in the first place, often is overlooked.  This study examines the effect of an ascriptive characteristic on this decision and thus its potentially consequential effects on who gets loans and on what terms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research questions for this project are: (1) How do loan officers determine creditworthiness among applicants, and how is this evaluation affected by their values on an ascriptive characteristic? (2) How does the standardization of risk assessment affect the exercise of loan officers’ discretion and the process of credit allocation?  These questions are addressed with a combination of qualitative and quantitative data collected over the course of a major institutional transformation, including administrative data, interviews, ethnographic observations, and written texts.  Collection of these data is made possible through access to a microcredit provider.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the proposed project is twofold: (1) to use paleoclimate reconstructions of past cold and warm climates, the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and Early Eocene, to constrain ECS and its state dependence in the Community Earth System Model (CESM) series including the latest CESM2, and (2) to provide a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the physics that govern past and future ECS. The proposed work will include development of new LGM and Eocene simulations using CESM2 and comparison of ECS in CESM2 simulations with existing LGM and Eocene simulations performed with earlier versions of the model (CESM1.2. and CCSM4) that have very different physics packages. Each simulation will be judged against a synthesis of proxy data and a new paleoclimate reanalysis product in order to evaluate the performance of the CESM versions and to identify the best estimate of ECS. The researchers will analyze this suite of simulations using climate feedback decomposition and radiative locking techniques to investigate the physical processes that regulate ECS under LGM, present, and Eocene conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential Broader Impacts include model simulations of the LGM and Eocene that would be made publicly available for the broad paleoclimate community for further investigation and model-data comparisons.

It is expected that the award will further the faculty member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution, and involve undergraduate students in research experiences. This project at Vorhees College seeks to develop computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction and segmentation methods using optimal sampling lattices and provides an opportunity for undergraduate students to enhance their education through research experiences in computer modeling. The researcher has established a strong collaboration with faculty at the University of South Carolina. <br/><br/>Computed tomography is an important tool to create the internal image of a physical body. Image reconstruction is to compute the internal image from the scanned data and image segmentation may help to locate the internal objects or their boundaries in the image. The usual CT computations are done on a Cartesian lattice whose pixels are squares or cubes. However optimal sampling lattices, such as 2D hexagonal and 3D face centered cubic and body centered cubic lattices, provide more efficient sampling and better adjacency relation than the traditional Cartesian lattices. In this project, for the 2D case, images will be reconstructed from scanned data using the filtered back-projection method over a hexagonal lattice and in a regular hexagonal region. Then image segmentation methods such as graph-cuts on the reconstructed images are applied. Because a CT machine rotates to perform scans from different directions, a 2D object to be scanned may be assumed to be circular. Since the circular region can be embedded into a regular hexagon more tightly than into a square, fewer number of lattice points may be involved and the lattice points can be efficiently indexed for image segmentation. Hence the computational time for image segmentation may be reduced and the quality may be improved. Computer simulations will be done to evaluate the new algorithms in terms of image segmentation quality and computational efficiency.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2003404.xml,Holomorphic Invariants of Knots and Contact Manifolds,NSF,2020-09-01,2024-08-31,359965,"Symplectic geometry is an area of mathematics that dates back to the 19th century, with its roots in physics and Newtonian mechanics. In the past few decades, symplectic geometry has emerged as an exciting and fundamental area of mathematical research, due in part to close connections with many other parts of mathematics as well as physics. It has had especially striking recent applications to topology, the study of geometric shapes and spaces, and particularly the theory of knots, loops of string that are tied together at their ends. The Principal Investigator will apply ideas from symplectic geometry to construct and study invariants of knots as well as geometric spaces in three and higher dimensions. Preliminary past work suggests that these invariants provide a surprising and unexpected bridge between several modern areas of mathematics (symplectic geometry, algebraic geometry, and quantum knot theory) and physics (string theory, a model for the fundamental forces that shape the universe). This project will explore this bridge, with the goal of creating and strengthening new lines of two-way communication between mathematics and theoretical physics. As part of this project, the Principal Investigator will also promote the training of early-career researchers in mathematics, especially through research experiences in mathematics for undergraduate students. In addition the project will provide research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The project supported by this award will focus on several related lines of research, all centered around holomorphic curves, which have become central to the modern study of symplectic geometry since work of Gromov in the 1980s. One direction builds on the construction of Fukaya categories, algebraic structures associated to symplectic manifolds that play a key role in Homological Mirror Symmetry. The present project will construct a version of the Fukaya category for contact manifolds, built out of knots in a contact manifold. A key motivation for studying this category for contact manifolds is that it can serve as a central repository for holomorphic-curve invariants of the contact manifold. In particular, it will be a key intermediary in a larger picture that brings together other categories, both geometric (infinitesimal Fukaya categories) and algebraic (microlocal sheaf categories). Another aspect of the project deals with a package of knot invariants called knot contact homology, which has been studied by the Principal Investigator in previous work. This project will investigate the connection between knot contact homology and certain other knot invariants such as HOMFLY-PT polynomials, using recent progress in topological string theory. Goals in this direction include developing a formula for colored HOMFLY-PT polynomials in terms of holomorphic curves and quantizing the augmentation variety, a knot invariant devised from knot contact homology, to produce a recurrence relation for these polynomials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Energy storage materials, as part of energy storage devices, are critical components in a wide variety of electronic and renewable energy production technologies. Electrochemical processes underpin most electrical energy storage systems such as batteries and capacitors. Organic materials offer unique advantages: they are readily available, and they can be designed and modified to have the required properties. In this project, researchers from Columbia University demonstrate that simple organic dye molecules can be used as tunable building blocks to form these types of energy storage materials. The research provides a fundamental understanding of the relationship between structure and properties relevant for energy storage performance. Insights from this research, may eventually address a key objective in the energy storage field, namely to design materials that combine the high energy density of batteries with the long cycle life and short charging times of capacitors.

Technical Summary<br/>This project contains three highly integrated Research Objectives: (1) Tuning molecular subunits to control electrochemical behavior; (2) Testing energy storage performances to enhance mechanistic understanding; and (3) Pushing the boundaries of organic materials for improved energy storage related properties. The combination of expertise, working in concert, enables the design, synthesis and study of organic electrode materials in a feedback loop that fosters a holistic understanding and engenders discovery of new properties. This project, which is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research at NSF,  creates a new family of organic electron-accepting (n-type) materials for energy storage composed of perylene diimide molecular units covalently linked into three-dimensional architectures using a variety of linkers. The research tests the hypothesis that the structure and electronic properties of perylene diimide architectures can be controlled by coupling complementary molecular building blocks whose chemical characteristics can be used to tune the electrochemical performances of the materials. Additionally, the researchers aim to increase the number of scientists as well as bridge related fields with science through education programs. The coordinated education effort spans K-8 outreach, curriculum development, and research training for undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral scientists. As part of this project a unique hands-on curriculum is developed that focuses on alternative energy and is designed for at-risk students in the local area. Through this outreach program, these students get immediate exposure to the engineering behind solar energy, which will help propel their interest and understanding within STEM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2003137.xml,MLWiNS: Wireless On-the-Edge Training of Deep Networks Using Independent Subnets,NSF,2020-06-01,2023-05-31,300000,"Neural networks (NN) have led to many recent successes in machine learning (ML). However, this success comes at a prohibitive cost: to obtain better ML models, larger and larger NNs need to be trained and deployed. This is a problem for mobile ML applications, where model training and inference need to be carried out in a timely fashion on a computation-/communication-light, and energy-limited platform. Such applications must run on handheld devices or drones and edge infrastructure and introduce new challenges: the heterogeneity of edge networks, the unreliability of the mobile devices, the computational and energy restrictions on such devices, and the communication bottlenecks in wireless networks. This project will address these challenges by investigating a new paradigm for computation- and communication-light, energy-limited distributed NN learning. Success in this project will produce fundamental ideas and tools that will make mobile distributed learning practical. Further, the project will generate courses and open-education resources that can attract diverse groups of students. <br/><br/>The specific idea investigated is a new class of distributed NN training algorithms, called independent subnetwork training (IST). IST decomposes a NN into a set of independent subnetworks. Each of those subnetworks is trained at a different device, for one or more backpropagation steps, before a synchronization step. Updated subnetworks are sent from edge-devices to the parameter server for reassembly into the original NN, before the next round of decomposition and local training. Because the subnetworks share no parameters, synchronization requires no aggregation—it is just an exchange of parameters. Moreover, each of the subnetworks is a fully operational classifier by itself; no synchronization pipelines between subnetworks are required. Key benefits of the proposed IST are that: i) IST assigns fewer training parameters to each mobile node per iteration, significantly reducing the communication overhead, and ii) each device trains a much smaller model, resulting in less computational costs and better energy consumption. Thus, there is good reason to expect that IST will scale much better than classic training algorithms for mobile applications. The project will investigate how to incorporate/extend IST to various NN architectures, develop new theories that explain the efficiency of IST, and unify theory with practice by proposing hardware-level system implementations that scale up and out for mobile applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002956.xml,Inorganic-aptamer hybrids for live cell imaging,NSF,2020-08-15,2023-07-31,372000,"With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Edith Glazer from the University of Kentucky to develop a short RNA sequence, called an aptamer, that can be observed to go through its life cycle in a cell using fluorescence microscopy. RNA has the task of translating the genetic information that is stored in DNA to create the proteins that serve as the workhorses in the cells of all living organisms. By observing how the amount of RNA changes in a cell, scientists can study how this flow of information is controlled in a time-dependent manner.  The Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) method is used to evolve RNA aptamers that bind to a small molecule containing a ruthenium (Ru) metal ion. This inorganic compound is designed to light up when it binds to form a complex with its specific RNA partner, as the two fit together in lock and key fashion.  The light emitted by the complex is visualized by fluorescence microscopy and other optical methods to “see” the RNA aptamer as it is being produced and later degraded. The research project provides training to undergraduate and graduate students in organic and inorganic synthesis, molecular biology, and various light microscopy techniques. The project will also be integrated into an educational program aimed at increasing retention and success rates in chemistry for students that are women and members of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The ability to accurately track and quantify RNA levels or localization, either on the subcellular or tissue levels, is important to the understanding of the role of RNA in the regulation of biological processes. This research project develops new emissive ruthenium (Ru(II)) compounds for tracking RNA in live cells through the creation of optimized pairs of luminescent compounds and RNA aptamers. The Ru(II) compounds do not suffer from photobleaching or excited state conformational changes, overcoming a key obstacle in the field of optical RNA reporters. The research increases the understanding of how synthetic modification alters excited state energies and relaxation pathways in luminescent Ru(II) complexes, and how specific modifications determine RNA selectivity. Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) is a powerful method to develop nucleic acids that bind target small molecules, and the combination of SELEX with modular chemical modification of the Ru(II) complex provides optimized binding partners. This project combines the techniques of synthetic chemistry, molecular biology, and microscopy to develop new tools to improve the understanding of RNA biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2003240.xml,RUI: Stem Cell Genesis in Leech,NSF,2020-08-15,2025-07-31,581225,"The process by which a single cell, such as a fertilized egg, develops into a complex, multicellular animal is perhaps one of the most fascinating questions in modern biology. Because all animals share a common ancestry many aspects of their development are conserved, particularly with regard to the network of genes they employ during the developmental process. Nonetheless, animals appear morphologically very different from each other (e.g., compare a starfish with a human) despite having a strikingly conserved set of developmental genes. To address this disparity, we focus on an understudied yet experimentally elegant organism, the leech, which offers a unique system for dissecting gene expression patterns in the critical early stages of embryogenesis. Specifically, leech embryos are atypically large and divide in asymmetrical patterns such that embryonic stem cells and their precursor cells can be readily identified and physically separated from the embryo, a technique that is not currently possible in more conventional model organisms (e.g., mouse, fly, nematode). Using modern molecular and genomics approaches, we will reconstruct the detailed molecular events that occur inside the embryo that lead to the formation, specification and maintenance of embryonic stem cells in leech. Our hypotheses will be tested directly by manipulating target genes during development, utilizing leech embryos as an experimental platform. This information will contribute to a broader understanding of how ancestral genetic pathways have evolved to generate the remarkable diversity of animal life we currently observe.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The spatiotemporal precision by which totipotent zygotes reproducibly generate properly situated cells (including stem cells) with varying degrees of more restricted cell fate potentials remains mostly an untenable question in conventional model organisms. The project offers an alternative and modern approach to this problem by applying bioinformatic and molecular techniques to a classical system that is uniquely well-suited for such methodologies. Specifically, glossiphoniid leeches provide experimentally tractable embryos whose stereotyped cleavages yield five bilateral pairs of large, identifiable and accessible, lineage-restricted stem cells of four distinct potencies, from which segmental mesoderm and ectoderm arise. Thus, one can routinely collect convenient quantities of RNA from small numbers of identifiable cells at each developmental step, from the zygote up to functioning stem cells. This project will generate transcriptional profiles for a set of uniquely defined stem cells, non-stem cells and selected precursors from which they arise in the leech zygote. Illumina sequencing and proven bioinformatic pipelines will be used to assemble in-depth transcriptomes for stages leading from zygote through the formation of four distinct classes of lineage-restricted stem cells (the M, N, O/P and Q teloblasts). Coupled with the availability of whole genome sequence, this presents an opportunity to profile transcriptional dynamics leading to stem cell formation on a cell-by-cell basis with unprecedented detail and completeness. Since the leech represents an understudied yet evolutionarily strategic member of the super-phylum Lophotrochozoa, this work will provide a critical perspective on the range of molecular genetic pathways leading to what we recognize operationally as stem cells.  The experiments are specifically designed to provide meaningful training activities to many undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2002863.xml,Collaborative Research: Dynamic interactions of individual neurons in supporting hippocampal network oscillations during behavior,NSF,2020-10-01,2025-09-30,550000,"Cognitive and motor behavior in the brain is controlled by networks of highly interconnected neurons. Neurons communicate via signals called spikes, which are generated by complex biological mechanisms. These mechanisms crucially depend on the subthreshold membrane potential activity, which is controlled by the complex interaction of ionic currents among other factors. Although the spiking patterns of the individual neurons are typically not regular, certain neuronal networks produce periodic oscillatory patterns. Important among them is the theta rhythm (4-10 Hz), which has been recorded in various brain areas by global activity measures, such as electroencephalography (EEG) or extracellular local field potentials (LFPs). Theta oscillations have been observed during motor activity and REM sleep, and are thought to play important roles in navigation, episodic memory and learning. Theta oscillations have also been observed at the subthreshold membrane potential level in brain slice preparations, and in behaving animals in the hippocampal CA1 area. However, how the oscillatory activity at the network level is linked to the biophysical properties of individual neurons remains largely unknown. In this project, the investigators will address this question using a combined experimental/theoretical approach. The Boston University team will perform experiments in behaving animals in CA1, and the NJIT team will carry out detailed computational modeling. This research is expected to generate a framework for describing and understanding how high-level neuronal oscillations depend on the oscillatory activity of individual neurons through complex network interactions. The PIs will also work to disseminate their imaging technology to the scientific community. This project will contribute to the cross-disciplinary training  of students and postdoctoral trainees in both experimental and computational neuroscience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central hypothesis of this project is that theta oscillations in the hippocampus are generated by resonant mechanisms involving the intrinsic properties of individual neurons, and circuit interactions that are tuned to amplify theta frequency inputs from the medial septum and possibly other external sources. We will address this hypothesis from an interdisciplinary perspective involving in vivo experiments, computational modeling, and dynamical systems analysis. We aim to understand the cellular and circuit mechanisms of hippocampal theta oscillations in vivo, and to create a theoretical framework to describe the biophysical and dynamic links between the oscillatory properties of individual neurons and network oscillations. The Boston University team will deploy a novel voltage imaging technique to measure subthreshold voltage dynamics and spiking activity from individual hippocampal neurons of defined cell types, including pyramidal cells and local interneurons (e.g. parvalbumim (PV)- and somatostatin (SOM)- positive ones) during behavioral states with varying levels of LFP theta oscillations. Additionally, to test the causal role of these interneurons in supporting theta oscillations, precision optogenetic activation and silencing will be used. The NJIT team will build biophysical models of the hippocampal network that include the intrinsic subthreshold oscillatory properties of the participating neurons and inputs from other areas (e.g., medial septum) to produce theta LFP oscillations. The results of the proposed research will provide mechanistic insights on the formation of hippocampal CA1 network oscillations with implications to learning, memory and other cognitive functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There has been decades of work that investigated how to prevent programs from leaking any information by making their access patterns ""oblivious"", i.e., independent from their execution. This project is motivated by the significant overhead that past techniques incur. The project introduces and investigates new relaxed notions of access pattern obliviousness, and discovers new algorithms that achieve these notions with a significantly reduced overhead.

The project establishes theoretical understanding, including new lower and upper bounds, of the extent to which various notions of obliviosness impact the performance of programs. The investigators also explore the practical performance of new privacy-preserving algorithms in cloud outsourcing and database scenarios.

The applications include the existence and characterization of optimal shapes in geometric problems that are helpful for scientists and engineers in understanding the universe and for optimal design of important objects and tools in the real world. The physics applications include describing energy critical states which are important for the understanding of the problems where an associated energy is quantized, such as, vortices of Euler flows and condensates in some Chern-Simons-Higgs models. One particularity of the equations under study in this project is that they verify the phenomena of strong interaction and quantization, which are enjoyed by many partial differential equations modeling real life problems. The aim of the research is to develop methods that can be used to establish existence mechanisms for such equations that verify the phenomena of quantization and strong interaction. The PI will mentor student research and organize Senior Seminar in Geometric Analysis project topics. The project also has a component that seeks to increase the number of underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines.

They are on one hand: nonlinear partial differential equations describing the conformal deformation of a Riemannian metric to one of prescribed Q-curvature type quantity, and on the other hand: systems of nonlinear partial differential equations describing the Mean Field and Toda problems from Chern-Simons Theory. These equations arise as Euler-Lagrange equation of energy functionals which are critical with respect to some Moser-Trudinger type inequalities. The focus of the project is on the resonant cases which are when accumulations points of some non-compact flow lines of a pseudo-gradient of the associated Euler-Lagrange functional, the so-called true critical points at infinity of the associated variation problem, occur. The project will investigate existence mechanism using the tools of critical points at infinity of Abbas Bahri.

2001516.xml,Principal Bundles and Higgs Bundles in Algebraic Geometry,NSF,2020-08-01,2024-07-31,180000,"The study of principal bundles began in the early XXth century by physicists as a formalism to describe electromagnetism. Later, this was extended to encompass strong and weak interactions, so that principal bundles became a basis for the so-called standard model - a physical theory describing three out of four fundamental interactions. In mathematics, principal bundles penetrate many areas: geometry, number theory, mathematical physics, and others. In 1950's Fields Medalist Jean-Pierre Serre recognized the importance of principal bundles in algebraic geometry. In his 1958 seminal paper he gave the first modern definition of a principal bundle and formulated a certain deep conjecture. This conjecture, as well as some remaining questions, are among the oldest unsolved foundational questions in mathematics. The first part of this project is aimed at proving some of these conjectures. The remaining parts of the projects are related to the so-called Higgs principal bundles, which can be thought of as mathematical incarnations of the Higgs boson -- a recently found elementary particle. These parts of the project belong to the famous Langlands program unifying number theory, algebraic geometry, harmonic analysis, and mathematical physics. This award will support continuing research in these areas. Advising students and giving talks at conferences are going to be part of the proposed activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, the first project originated from the Grothendieck-Serre conjecture on principal bundles, which was settled recently for rings containing fields by Ivan Panin and the PI. The PI plans to extend the proof to the mixed characteristic case as well as to work on the purity conjecture for principal bundles. The purity conjecture is, in a sense, the next logical step after the Grothendieck-Serre conjecture. In the second project, the PI intends to construct and prove the local Langlands duality for Hitchin systems and to derive some cases of the global Langlands duality for Hitchin systems from the local case. The third project is devoted to counting motivic volumes of moduli stacks of principal Higgs bundles.

2001611.xml,NSF Center for Sustainable Nanotechnology,NSF,2020-09-01,2025-08-31,16000000,"The NSF Center for Sustainable Nanotechnology (CSN) seeks to understand how nanoparticles, particles that are at least 10,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair, transform and interact in and with water and biological systems. Nanoparticles can vary in elemental composition, structure, and properties, which makes them useful for industries ranging from electronics, to batteries, to cosmetics. As nanoparticle use becomes more widespread, however, they are appearing in the environment.  When nanoparticles are incorporated into biological systems they may induce unusual behavior that is beneficial or harmful, but is as of yet poorly understood. For instance, due to their small size, some nanoparticles can easily pass through some cell membranes. With very high surface area to volume ratios, nanoparticles can also be highly reactive, which may trigger chemical changes in the environment or to the nanoparticle itself. The CSN applies a ""make, measure, model"" strategy to develop new functional nanomaterials with increased sustainability and reduced biological impact. Expertise with synthetic methods, in situ analytical techniques, and computational methods is leveraged to understand, predict, and control nanoparticle properties and their chemical interactions with the environment and biological systems. The CSN addresses key knowledge gaps in the areas of nanoparticle properties which will result in better prediction of specific nanoparticle chemical properties and their biological interactions. This will ultimately serve the national interest by allowing for the design of more effective and more benign nanoparticles for many applications. Some of the systems the CSN investigates include: transition metal oxides and phosphates and two-dimensional quantum materials; gold, diamond and silicon based nanoparticles with defined organic and inorganic surface coatings; and as well as emerging nanoparticle compositions that exhibit fundamental new science and utility, such as those based on polymeric carbon dots, and nanovacancies in nanodiamond. This integrated, multi-institutional, and collaborative team involves researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, University of Minnesota, Boston University, Georgia Institute of Technology, Johns Hopkins University, Augsburg University, University of California-Riverside, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, University of Iowa, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and the Connecticut Agricultural Experimental Station. The Center has a strong innovation component that involves the translation of research results into intellectual property, as well as other collaborations with several industrial partners. The CSN has an inclusive and transparent management approach that enables a positive Center climate and facilitates the integration of student learning across Center activities. Students broaden and deepen their technical expertise and grant writing through student laboratory exchanges and seed grant opportunities. The CSN places special emphasis on communication training. Example mechanisms to develop student communication skills are the popular Sustainable Nano Blog, http://sustainable-nano.com/, and the Spanish language-based Nano Sostenible Blog, http://nano-sostenible.com/. These are key components of the Center's informal science communication efforts, and students have ample opportunity to participate in these educational websites. Webinars on fostering technical innovation, internship opportunities, and opportunities to serve on the advisory board are mechanisms through which students further develop their professional skill sets. The CSN is committed to broadening participation efforts and incorporates summer research experiences for undergraduates and veterans, and relationships with minority-serving institutions, primarily undergraduate institutions, and community colleges as ways to address inclusivity. The strong focus on the CSN climate helps to ensure all participants feel welcomed, valued, and supported. Partnerships with the University of Puerto Rico at Cayey and Rio Piedras, the University of Texas Rio Grand Valley, Tuskegee University, and Georgia State University help to ensure that a diverse group of students can participate in the CSN where they develop not only the skills mentioned above, but also an understanding of the need to approach questions in chemistry with an awareness of sustainability, inclusivity, and interdisciplinarity. The CSN experience will prepare participants to make unique future contributions as members of the chemical workforce. <br/><br/>The CSN organizes their goals along four focus areas. One area focuses on establishing nanoparticle structure–function relationships. Chemical composition, size, shape, and organic or inorganic surface modifications are investigated with a combination of computational and experimental approaches. Transition metal oxides, nanoparticles comprised of earth-abundant elements, and nanoparticles that demonstrate novel properties or new utility are focal points. A second area of investigation centers on understanding nanoparticle transformations that occur in the environment and in biological media. Chemical changes in the nanoparticle core, the roles of inorganic and organic ions to impact nanoparticle stability, and surface structure are some of the areas explored. The third CSN thrust area explores nanoparticle coatings, referred to as coronas, formed by their exposure to the environment or biological systems at aqueous interfaces as a function of time. Analytical and computational approaches are developed to characterize and model the chemical nature and formation mechanisms of nanoparticle coronas. The fourth area is a chemistry-focused investigation of the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles and their interactions with biological systems. Nanoparticles with well-defined composition, structure, and surface chemistry are used to correlate, better understand, and predict nanoparticle physicochemical properties, spatial and temporal interactions at biological surfaces, and the direct or indirect effects on molecular interactions in cells and organisms. The CSN enriches the chemistry community by providing new tools for characterizing chemical processes at nanoparticle surfaces and by developing experimentally validated computational methods to predict the molecular-level behavior of complex materials in aqueous media. CSN participants are engaged in activities aimed at facilitating the creation and dissemination of knowledge, enhancing innovation and translation of research products and outcomes to the commercial sector, and providing unique education and training opportunities for students and postdoctoral researchers from diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Given the sensitivity of flowering times to climatic conditions, a thorough understanding of how plants respond to changing environments is necessary for predicting the consequences for pollinators, herbivores, parasites, and plant populations. A record of historical flowering times is found within the nation's herbaria – collections of dried and pressed plants. In 2018, the California Phenology Thematic Collections Network (CAP-TCN) was established to advance our understanding of flowering time changes over time. The network brought together 22 California universities, research stations, natural history collections, and botanical gardens, with the goal of imaging and recording the flowering status of approximately one million herbarium specimens collected over the past 150 years. These data are freely available through the newly established Consortium of California Herbaria (CCH2) portal. This project will add a partnership of seven new collections and six new institutions to the CAP-TCN, contributing an additional 150,000 herbarium specimens. The project participants will be fully integrated into CAP-TCN training and outreach activities including Notes from Nature online expeditions, which educate and involve members of the public in learning about herbarium specimens and flowering phenology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By expanding the geographic scope to encompass Oregon and the northern Baja California peninsula, the CAP-TCN will now cover the entire California Floristic Province, a biodiversity hotspot of global significance. This will increase the number of species with imaged specimens across their entire range from 1,217 to 1,850, a 55% increase. The addition of 80,000 Oregon and Baja California specimens to CCH2 will facilitate efficient specimen-based analyses of the entire California Floristic Province and for the first time allow a more objective and reproducible specimen-based delineation of its geographic boundaries. Three institutions in California and Nevada will fill key geographic gaps for northwestern California, the northern San Joaquin Valley, and the Mojave Desert. Two additional institutions will significantly increase CAP-TCN representation of 1) the ecologically important and taxonomically complex genus Arctostaphylos (manzanita); and 2) introduced and invasive species of importance to California agriculture, rangelands, and native ecosystems. An estimated 25 additional undergraduates will participate in digitizing activities. Ongoing public outreach efforts about the floras of Oregon and Baja California at Oregon State University and the San Diego Natural History Museum will also benefit from the newly imaged specimens.  Data will be shared through online resources, including iDigBio.org.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001122.xml,Research PGR: Genome-enabled characterization of orphan receptor-like kinases in plants.,NSF,2020-06-15,2020-10-31,2000000,"This project will improve understanding of an important class of proteins, the so-called receptor-like kinases. Like cellular sentries, receptor-like kinases have crucial functions in sensing and orchestrating responses to environmental cues. Kinases perceive molecular signals from other organisms (like pathogens) or from neighboring cells and pass signals along to other proteins to initiate defense responses or other changes, such as halting growth. Consistent with the importance of these functions, kinases are one of the most abundant plant protein families; however, kinases have also proven to be difficult to study. New advances in both understanding and technology will be used in this project to enable matching of plant kinases to the signals that they detect and to the downstream “recipients” of the information, thereby revealing the function of these proteins. Improvements in knowledge of kinases will open new avenues for improving plant production for food, feed, fiber, and energy. In addition, the project will train at least five young scientists to use advanced technologies and will provide plant science educational opportunities to ~60 teachers via professional development workshops, introduce ~30 Native American high school and undergraduate students to research via week-long plant signaling research project workshops, and provide ~40 summer and academic year undergraduate research opportunities that meld plant and data science.<br/><br/>This research will characterize the functions and substrates of receptor-like kinases (RLKs) of Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean. Objective 1 aims to reveal RLK functions by combing quantification of phosphorylation and S-acylation (e.g., palmitoylation) as indicators of involvement of an RLK in a biological process. This analysis will take advantage of new results that suggest that these posttranslational modifications are antagonistic. The project will use proteomics technology to deeply and quantitatively sample total and plasma membrane-enriched proteins during rice internode development, with and without drought stress; and soybean and rice root responses to conserved putative small secreted peptides. The relatively well-understood Arabidopsis- Pseudomonas syringae interaction will be examined to optimize methods. The focus on peptide hormone ligands and root growth will survey broadly across predicted small secreted peptide families. Objective 2 takes a complementary approach to revealing RLK function, by creating deep (12k) peptide libraries for each species and screening them against purified protein kinases with the goal of identifying kinase clients for at least 25 novel kinases. The kinase client assay accelerates assignment of downstream signaling and its usefulness has been demonstrated by rapid community adoption. In Objective 3, experimental results will be extended using machine learning approaches to predict plant phosphorylation sites and specific kinase clients. Proteome data will be used for molecular network reconstruction and for comparative analysis to identify patterns in RLK signaling. Results and predictions will be used to enhance previously established databases, P3DB and SoyKB, which are already well-used by the community, amplifying project value.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2000779.xml,Collaborative Research: Developing Business Communication Skills in Manufacturing Technician Education,NSF,2020-08-15,2024-07-31,383059,"The advanced manufacturing and production fields have growing need for skilled technicians who can communicate effectively in teams.  In response to this workforce demand, the project team will develop and test an adaptive virtual reality (VR) platform to help manufacturing technician students learn business communication skills.  The platform will deliver interactive case studies that allow students to practice business communication skills needed in a smart factory context.  To support integration of these adaptive VR case studies within courses, faculty in advanced manufacturing programs will participate in extensive professional development as they collaboratively develop new VR business communication case studies.  In addition, the project will support faculty externships in industry to enhance their knowledge of current trends, skills requirements, new tools, and career opportunities in advanced manufacturing.  This knowledge will help them improve their teaching and better serve their students.  To strengthen the alignment between coursework and job tasks, the project draws on the long-standing partnership between Ivy Tech Community College of Indiana, Purdue University, and industry partners.  Recognizing that the incumbent manufacturing workforce is maturing, the project also focuses on fostering and investigating the communication skills that facilitate the transfer of highly specialized technical skills, knowledge, and expertise across the multiple generations in the manufacturing workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project rests on the implementation of a research and development cycle that facilitates the development, testing, investigation, and revision of project activities and deliverables for improvement and goal attainment (e.g., advanced manufacturing technicians who develop the technical knowledge and skills, as well as the soft skills to work efficiently and effectively in modern manufacturing).  To answer a priori and emerging questions, the project will conduct a mixed methods study to advance knowledge of the effectiveness of integrating the learning of technical knowledge/skills with soft skills in curricular and educational materials (i.e., case studies within a virtual reality platform).  The quantitative and qualitative study will examine the integration of manufacturing and communication job tasks through pre-post outcomes assessments, structured interviews and focus groups, descriptive and trend analyses, analyses of the quality of deliverables and products, and thematic content analyses of information from interviews, focus group discussions, and open-ended survey questions.

The focus is on the measurement of peroxy radicals, reactive species that participate in photochemical transformations of organic compounds that can lead to the formation of the secondary products, such as ozone and secondary aerosol. The results of this study will lead to an improved ability to evaluate atmospheric chemistry models that rely on a solid understanding of underlying radical chemistry.<br/><br/>Two new methods for speciating peroxy radicals include an atmospheric pressure transverse ionization technique using ammonium or alkyl amine ions, and an indirect method in which peroxy radicals are chemically converted to hydroperoxides and then subsequently detected using iodide or bromide chemical ionization mass (CIMs) spectrometry. These new techniques will be tested during field deployments in New York City and in a forested area in New Jersey, spanning a wide range in nitrogen oxide (NOx) concentrations and volatile organic compound (VOC) precursors.

2002202.xml,Predicting mammalian communities in Mesoamerican 'sky islands' using species traits and spatiotemporal patterns of environmental suitability,NSF,2020-07-15,2025-06-30,309000,"Understanding and predicting shifts in species geographic distributions (or ranges) is important to inform decision-making on a range of pressing issues in health, agriculture, and natural-resource management. Many human activities increase the patchiness of habitats in an area, thus affecting species distributions. However, predicting the effects of fragmentation on particular species remains difficult. To forecast which species will remain in each patch and which will move into the areas between them, scientists need to consider not only their preferred habitats but also the environmental history of the region and other traits of the species themselves (like body size, dispersal ability, and reproductive rates). Here, the researchers will test a new model to forecast species distributions in fragmented landscapes, applying it to mammals associated with mountain forests. The research will evaluate the roles of environmental history and species traits in predicting a species' presence or absence in particular forest patches. Graduate and undergraduate students contributing to the project will gain training in data collection, analyses using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and computer coding. In addition to publishing scientific papers on the findings, the team will conduct workshops and produce computer code, tutorials, and webinars. <br/><br/>In a system of naturally fragmented, montane habitat islands or sky islands, the researchers will test hypotheses regarding differential colonization and extinction among species using traits, allometric scaling (based on body size), and spatial patterns of present and past climate. To predict the particular species occurring in given patches, they will implement the new Constraint-based model of Dynamic Island Biogeography (C-DIB). The team will do so studying small non-volant mammals associated with currently isolated mesic montane forests of the Sierra Madre Oriental in Mexico (the mainland of this system). Specifically, the researchers will: 1. obtain occurrence records and trait data for species of the mainland; 2. make predictions for each species and patch within one sky island complex using body size, trophic level, and measures of connectivity and area from ecological niche models applied to present and past conditions; 3. determine the species composition of the patches by conducting field inventories; and 4. perform statistical tests of differential colonization and extinction among species. This project will advance understanding of the factors that affect species ranges across space and over time, empowering researchers to improve biodiversity prediction and spark further development and use of the C-DIB in basic and applied science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the spatial pattern of glacial-interglacial climate and environmental variability in the tropics underscores the need for longer and better constrained data sets from the region to fully understanding forcings and potential feedbacks. The tropics play a crucial role in global moisture balance and heat redistribution. Additionally, environmental change in continental systems is also generally greater in amplitude and more spatially heterogeneous than in marine environments, where many of the early records of tropical climate variability are located. Thus, terrestrial records from the tropics are particularly necessary to fully resolve regional variability of glacial-interglacial climate variability and for comparison to existing high latitude records. This project will contribute to an enhanced understanding of Neotropical paleoclimate over the last 400 thousand years, and will illuminate temperature, hydroclimate, and vegetation shifts for a key location in Central America, Lake Petén Itzá. The researchers will mentor students in scientific communication with the broader public, focusing on the societal relevance of paleoclimate research, and will develop a paleoclimate-based, data-integrated exercise that will be used for hands-on undergraduate classes. Additionally, the project team will develop an open-access article describing paleoclimate science in an online journal aims to inspire and educate the next generation of scientists, reaching a large global student audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lake Petén Itzá, Guatemala, lies in a region dominated by trade wind migration and is influenced by sea surface temperature changes in the subtropical Atlantic basin. It thus represents a key spatial node for understanding large-scale climate variability of the northern tropics of the Americas. The investigators will use existing, archived drill cores from Lake Petén Itzá to develop records of changing Neotropical temperature (using brGDGTs) and precipitation (using δD values of leaf waxes), and the response of terrestrial vegetation (using δ13C values of leaf waxes) to these changes, in order to examine climate and ecosystem evolution over the past 400 ka. The investigators will integrate findings from the organic geochemical sedimentary reconstructions with previously published and currently on-going sedimentological and palynological research from Petén Itzá. Proxy-model comparison work will also be completed using these integrated reconstructions and other regionally available records with water isotope-enabled GCM experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Bryophytes and lichens are functionally related as the main hosts for cryptobiotic communities forming minute ""forests"" that provide a matrix of habitats for many microscopic organisms, including tardigrades, mites, rotifers, micro-mollusks, microalgae, microfungi, and prokaryotes. These communities have global relevance and perform essential functions on our planet, for example, the biological soil crusts that harbor these communities form a ""living skin"" covering approximately 12% of  Earth's terrestrial surface.  In addition, professional training will be provided for a large number of undergraduates, with a focus on leveraging local resources to promote underrepresented students in STEM fields.  Students will be trained in digitization and collections management, and will contribute to the education and public outreach components of the project. <br/><br/>Through this collaboration, twenty-five US herbaria will image and digitize associated metadata for almost 1.2 million bryophyte and lichen herbarium specimens held in US institutions. Imaging the physical specimens of these organisms and integrating data from comparative genomics, nucleotide sequence data, and other resources is unprecedented on this scale. These integrated data will form a critical resource for evolutionary and ecological studies, that may, in turn, lead to a deeper understanding of (1) how biocrusts perform their ecosystem functions, (2) the roles of bryophytes and lichens in carbon/nitrogen cycling, (3) the dynamic evolution of symbioses in space and time, (4) the historical and contemporary drivers of endophyte co-diversification, and (5) the evolution of biodiversity using spatial phylogenetics. Deep-learning approaches using repurposed digital images may also provide powerful new investigative tools.  Digitized data will be shared with iDigBio.org and other repositories.  A multi-pronged approach to broader impacts spans from K-12 to participatory citizen science initiatives.  These include (1) diverse digital, interactive, and object-based learning outreach programs; (2) online lesson plans; (3) science youth groups; (4) Science Clubs and public educator workshops; and (5) a series of videos using Learning Glass – which collapses the perspectives of viewer and presenter into one shared perspective.

2002584.xml,Collaborative Research: Leveraging Massive Smartphone Location Data to Improve Understanding and Prediction of Behavior in Hurricanes,NSF,2020-09-01,2024-08-31,191937,"In this project, newly available anonymous smartphone location data will be used to dramatically improve understanding of how households behave during hurricanes (e.g., how many people will evacuate, when, how, from where, and to where). Although previous research has provided valuable knowledge about population behavior in hurricanes, important gaps remain. Available models have limited ability to predict behavior in future hurricanes. Differences in behavior across different types of households and people, such as tourists or people without vehicles, are not well known. Neither are the sequence and timing of events that unfold for individuals over the duration of a hurricane. These gaps are largely due to limitations in the traditional types of data that have supported past research—surveys, interviews, and focus groups. This project will promote the science of modeling evacuation behavior by capitalizing on the availability of a new type of data— anonymous location information from smartphones—to make a leap forward in understanding and predicting the behavior of the population during hurricane evacuations. The project will advance national welfare and benefit society by substantially improving the ability to manage future evacuations. During a hurricane, officials make many highly consequential decisions, including issuing official evacuation orders, messaging the public, opening shelters, staging materials and staff, implementing special traffic plans, executing support for vehicle-less populations, and preparing to undertake rescues. All of these depend directly on how many people are expected to evacuate, when, how, from where, and to where. By providing a more accurate and nuanced prediction of population behavior during hurricanes, this project will enable officials to make those decisions in a more informed and effective way. To ensure findings will be translated to practice quickly and effectively, the research has been designed so that it can be integrated into the current decision-making tools and processes used by emergency managers. Our practitioner partners from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Florida and North Carolina state emergency management agencies will also help us share findings with the larger emergency management community. This study will facilitate the development of a procedure to acquire and analyze, in real time, similar data for other evacuation events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Availability of new smartphone location data offers a rare opportunity to transform the study of population behavior in hurricanes. The data offers many benefits, including samples that are orders of magnitude larger than previously typical; offering cohesive timelines of individual behavior; providing direct observations not subject to recall or reporting bias; being available within 24 hours of movement; and being available at low cost in consistent form for many hurricanes. Combining the power of the new data with domain expertise based on traditional survey and interview data will advance the science in this area in five ways. First, we will improve knowledge by testing hypotheses from the traditional literature using a larger, independent dataset and new hypotheses not easily testable in the past. Second, multiple events may happen during the course of a hurricane, including hurricane-related events (e.g., hurricane turns, intensifies), official actions (e.g., issue official orders, close schools), and personal events (e.g., released from work). Each person experiences some or all of these events in a sequence over a hurricane’s duration. We will use sequential pattern mining to describe key observable events and actions, their possible sequences, the probabilities of different sequences, and duration distributions of each event. This modeling of the sequence and timing of events for individuals, which has not been done before, will illuminate the range of ways hurricane behavior, official actions, personal decisions, and time markers interact and unfold, and help identify promising points of intervention for evacuation support. Third, we will develop new statistical models to predict the probability a person will evacuate at each time period and go to a particular geographic destination as a function of attributes of the individual/household, official events, hurricane, forecast, time markers, and past actions since the hurricane formed. These models will offer improved out-of-sample predictive power by identifying influences on behavior that are not observable with small datasets; by improving the ability to predict geographic destination, which is important for estimating clearance times; and by, for the first time, taking advantage of observations of behavior early in the event that may be leading indicators of final behavior. Fourth, we will test the route choice assumptions implicit in traffic models used to predict clearance times, and determine the effects of road closures on traffic patterns during evacuation and reentry. The new data will allow testing that is more detailed and comprehensive than previously possible through isolated traffic counts and surveys. Finally, we will identify new behaviors and questions for future traditional research using a general inductive approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By repeatedly applying polynomials, one creates dynamical systems, which may model weather patterns, economics, or ecological changes.  But there are many other functions that describe dynamical systems that cannot be given by simple formulas, and are therefore much more difficult to study.  By adapting techniques used to study the symmetries of surfaces, the principal investigator will study the dynamical properties of such functions.  The principal investigator will also continue her outreach efforts with elementary and middle-school students, undergraduate research, and leadership in professional development programs for graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These projects focus on the mapping class group, which is the group of homeomorphisms of a surface up to homotopy.  With a unifying theme of using techniques from covering space theory and geometric group theory, this agenda has two broad directions, one dynamical and one algebraic.  In the dynamical direction, the planned research will work towards developing an algorithm to identify when a branched cover of the sphere is equivalent to a rational function.  The principal investigator and her collaborators have developed an analogous algorithm for polynomials using techniques from the study of mapping class groups, and these investigations will adapt the existing algorithm to certain families of branched covers of the sphere.  In the algebraic direction, the planned research seeks to understand the algebraic structure and representations of subgroups of the mapping class group that normalize a finite group action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001732.xml,CAREER: Operation of Distribution Grids in the Context of High-Penetration Distributed Energy Resources and Flexible Loads,NSF,2019-08-18,2024-09-30,383164,"The number of distributed energy resources (DERs) and flexible loads such as photovoltaic (PV) panels, electric vehicles (EVs), and energy storage systems (ESSs) are rapidly growing at the consumer end. These small distributed devices connect to low voltage power distribution grids via power electronic interfaces that can support bi-directional power flows. Despite being small in size, if aggregated, these devices a provide significant portion of the energy and ancillary services (e.g., reactive power support, frequency regulation, load following) necessary for reliable and secure operation of electric power grids. In future distribution grids, with numerous such small active devices, real-time control and aggregation will entail computational challenges. The computational challenges further increase when the aggregation requires coordination with legacy grid control actions which involve integer decision variables, such as load tap changers, capacitor banks, and network switches. This CAREER project concentrates around solving operational and computational issues for distribution grids with large penetration of DERs and flexible loads.<br/> <br/>This CAREER project aims to develop: i) novel mixed-integer second order cone programming (MISOCP) models of distribution optimal power flow and aggregation, which are computationally tractable for practical-sized power grids with thousands of aggregation nodes,  ii)  distributed control algorithms in dispatching active and reactive power of DER and flexible loads in real time, and iii)  a probabilistic dispatch model of the assets at the grid level and at the DER aggregation level that minimizes expected constraint violation of distribution grid operations. These distributed optimization and control models will provide dispatch solutions sufficiently fast that the aggregation at the distribution level could easily track grid signals for applications ranging over various time resolutions. The educational and outreach activities of this CAREER project include: i) to design advanced curriculum on distributed control and optimization to train on-campus and online undergraduate and graduate level power engineering students, ii) to motivate K-12 students in pursuing science, technology,  engineering,  and math (STEM)  by providing them opportunities to participate on several activities at Michigan Tech's Smart Grid Operations Center (SGOC), and iii) to reach out to Hispanic students in Texas and Native American students in South Dakota through active demonstration of fundamental power engineering concepts by using  Michigan Tech's Mobile Microgrid Laboratory."
2003297.xml,"Label free, biomimetic sensors for hormones and neurotransmitters",NSF,2020-07-01,2025-05-31,600000,"Abnormal regulation of molecules such as hormones and neurotransmitters that are secreted from cells in the human body leads to a wide range of debilitating conditions, including addiction, depression, diabetes and many others.  A major challenge in understanding the normal and abnormal regulation of hormone and neurotransmitter secretion is the inability to measure these molecules with sufficient selectivity and sensitivity as they are released from cells.  This research project aims to overcome this challenging by developing a new biomimetic sensor platform that can measure the secretion of a wide range of important hormones and neurotransmitters that are biologically important, but that cannot be detected adequately using currently existing methods. The capability to make such measurements enables the research community to better understand, and ultimately correct, the underlying biochemical mechanisms in hormone and neurotransmitter regulation.  The project provides educational and interdisciplinary research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Arizona (a Hispanic Serving Institution) and Yavapai Community College, thereby helping to build a diverse science, technology, engineering and mathematics workforce.<br/><br/>The development of sensors that are capable of detecting various single chemical compounds, as well as multiple chemical compounds released simultaneously, from cells has proven challenging for the vast majority of hormones and neuropeptides, and many neurotransmitters.  This research project addresses the critical need for new, label-free measurement strategies for hormones and neurotransmitters by developing a novel class of electrophysiological sensors based upon a new sensor transducer concept that is readily modified to enable detection of a wide range important biochemical analytes.  These electrophysiological sensors are comprised of protein transducers that generate a high-gain electrical signal upon analyte binding, including ion channel proteins or ion channel-coupled receptor proteins. The transducers are embedded in an ultrastable lipid membrane that is integrated into a micropipette architecture.  In addition to single analyte sensors, sensors comprised of multiple, differing sensor elements that enable quantification of multiple analytes are being developed.  This sensor platform provides a modular approach for developing highly sensitive and selective sensors with high spatial and temporal resolution. The project focuses on development and characterization of biomimetic electrophysiological sensors with emphasis on key variables that affect sensor function and performance. The work targets optimization of lipid membranes and protein transducers, the design of multianalyte sensors and performance evaluation in model cellular systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2001724.xml,Investigating the Barriers to Retention and Tenure for Black and Hispanic Engineering Faculty at R1 Institutions,NSF,2020-05-01,2023-08-31,400000,"The purpose of this project is to identify factors that facilitate or impede progress toward tenure for Black and Hispanic engineering faculty (BHEF) on the tenure track at four-year Research1 (R1) Institutions of Higher Education (IHE) and how those factors contribute to faculty retention and/or turnover. This project seeks to uncover how departments that do well in retaining BHEF might operate differently from those that do not. The objectives are to (a) empirically explore the link between faculty socialization and BHEF tenure and retention, (b) better understand the “push/pull” (i.e., promote/impede) factors that affect that relationship, and (c) how those factors look in IHEs/engineering departments that retain their BHEF when compared to those that do not. This research will provide greater insight into how to retain underrepresented BHEF in the critical field of engineering. When talented BHEF are tenured, institutions are better positioned to develop a diverse, globally competitive, next generation of engineers. This in turn, contributes to increased economic competitiveness in the United States. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Scholars maintain that socialization (i.e., the norms and values transmitted) is largely responsible for the non-inclusive departmental environments that spur higher rates of attrition for underrepresented minority faculty. However, this theory has not been robustly examined. A sequential mixed methods design will be employed to address three research questions. Phase One explores, “What are the factors that facilitate and/or impede progress towards tenure among pre-tenured BHEF at four-year R1 institutions?” and includes a national survey to all professors of engineering at R1 higher education institutions nationally to determine the relationship between diversity climate and faculty turnover intentions. Diversity climate will be measured by the Diversity Climate Perceptions scale (Mor Barak et al., 1998) and the Diversity Promise scale (Chrobot-Mason, 2003), while turnover intentions will be measured by the TI-6 instrument (Shore &amp; Martin, 1989). The initial results will be disaggregated by sub-disciplines, (e.g., civil, electrical) to determine any potential differences in engineering subfields. Phase Two addresses two research questions: “How do the factors that facilitate and/or impede progress towards tenure operate in contributing to faculty retention or turnover?” and “How do IHEs/engineering departments that retain BHEF socialize their faculty differently from those that do not?” The results of the phase one survey will be used to identify the sample of late pre-tenure professors (self-identified as Black or Hispanic) from which to recruit participants for follow-up interviews over a two-year period. The investigators will examine the rationale and factors influencing decisions to remain in or depart from the professoriate; and if they depart, where they have gone and what they plan to do. In addition to identifying supports and barriers to tenure for BHEF, this research is expected to reveal ways to mitigate the exclusionary effect of barriers to better sustain the diversification of engineering faculty, as well as provide insights to create inclusive IHE/departments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

2000021.xml,Collaborative Research: ECR EIE DCL: The Development and Validation of a Scale to Assess Epistemic Exclusion in Minoritized and Non-Minoritized STEM Faculty,NSF,2020-09-01,2025-08-31,550194,"This collaborative research project, involving Michigan State University, the University of North Texas and the University of Michigan, will examine whether epistemic exclusion, a form a scholarly devaluation, may create a barrier to the full inclusion and participation of women and faculty of color in STEM. Epistemic exclusion is the devaluation of certain types of scholarship that occurs when invisible biases in systems of evaluation are coupled with prejudice toward, and negative stereotypes about, historically underrepresented groups.  Because faculty members' career outcomes (e.g., promotion, tenure, and turnover intentions) are determined by how well they meet evaluative standards, bias in systems of evaluation that disproportionately harm women and faculty of color may impede their retention and advancement in academia. The project team will create and validate a scale assessing faculty epistemic exclusion. <br/><br/>Results of the project have the potential to benefit society by providing a tool that researchers can use to investigate epistemic exclusion in STEM faculty.  Advancing this line of research may result in potential interventions and policy changes at institutions of higher education that improve the retention and promotion of women and underrepresented minority STEM faculty at our nation’s colleges and universities.  There is a plan for dissemination to scholarly audiences through peer-reviewed presentation and publications in professional journals that will help inform the research and academic communities.  <br/><br/>This project is supported by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.

2001465.xml,CDS&E: Numerical Investigation of Two-Particle Response Functions of Correlated Materials,NSF,2020-08-01,2024-07-31,330000,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports theoretical and computational research aimed at understanding the relationship between experimental measurements and numerical simulations of materials in which strong electronic correlation effects are important. In particular, the team will focus on obtaining computational data simulating the response to externally applied fields in superconducting and magnetic materials.<br/><br/>Materials consist of electrons and ions arranged in a crystal lattice. In some materials, the motion of an electron is strongly interdependent on, or correlated with, the motion of many other electrons. As a consequence, these materials may exhibit unusual behavior including superconductivity, magnetism, or charge order. This unusual behavior can often be investigated with experimental probes that measure the response of a material to externally applied fields. Our standard analytical tools for describing this response are inadequate, and numerical methods are therefore needed. The subject of this project is the development and application of accurate and controlled numerical methods that can describe these materials and their response to applied fields, and compute experimentally measured quantities.<br/><br/>The project will contribute to broader impacts by supporting the development and maintenance of sustainable open-source community software libraries, which will accelerate the development of future codes as well as provide reliable and state-of-the-art applications to the science community. The software libraries currently maintained by the PI are among the few established open-source libraries for calculations on strongly correlated systems. As part of the project, graduate students will be trained in modern theoretical techniques and in scientific software development.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This project is aimed at understanding the relation between experimentally measured two-particle response functions and generalized susceptibilities of effective low-energy lattice models in systems where strong electronic correlations are important, and in particular systems where superconducting or magnetic order has been established. The project will combine newly developed numerical methods with large-scale calculations to compute emergent fluctuations, as well as the response functions measured in superconducting, charge ordered, and magnetic systems.<br/><br/>Susceptibilities reveal important information about collective excitations of a system and are directly measurable in experiment. However, the strong correlation physics of generalized susceptibilities measured by two-particle probes such as neutron scattering is theoretically not well understood, especially in ordered phases. This project will analyze two-particle correlation functions in fermion lattice model systems inside and outside the superconducting phase. By providing reliable results for the susceptibilities of fermionic lattice models and by computing response functions, this work will facilitate the separation of true electron correlation physics from model-dependent artifacts, which in turn will aid in the interpretation of experiments.<br/><br/>Correlated electron materials are essential for modern technological applications such as information technology, energy technology, materials science, and nanoscience. By clarifying the basic behavior of susceptibilities and their relation to experimental work, this project will contribute to our understanding of correlated materials and their characterization.<br/><br/>The project will contribute to broader impacts by supporting the development and maintenance of sustainable open-source community software libraries, which will accelerate the development of future codes as well as provide reliable and state-of-the-art applications to the science community.

Bryophytes and lichens are functionally related as the main hosts for cryptobiotic communities forming minute ""forests"" that provide a matrix of habitats for many microscopic organisms, including tardigrades, mites, rotifers, micro-mollusks, microalgae, microfungi, and prokaryotes. These communities have global relevance and perform essential functions on our planet, for example, the biological soil crusts that harbor these communities form a ""living skin"" covering approximately 12% of  Earth's terrestrial surface.  In addition, professional training will be provided for a large number of undergraduates, with a focus on leveraging local resources to promote underrepresented students in STEM fields.  Students will be trained in digitization and collections management, and will contribute to the education and public outreach components of the project. <br/><br/>Through this collaboration, twenty-five US herbaria will image and digitize associated metadata for almost 1.2 million bryophyte and lichen herbarium specimens held in US institutions. Imaging the physical specimens of these organisms and integrating data from comparative genomics, nucleotide sequence data, and other resources is unprecedented on this scale. These integrated data will form a critical resource for evolutionary and ecological studies, that may, in turn, lead to a deeper understanding of (1) how biocrusts perform their ecosystem functions, (2) the roles of bryophytes and lichens in carbon/nitrogen cycling, (3) the dynamic evolution of symbioses in space and time, (4) the historical and contemporary drivers of endophyte co-diversification, and (5) the evolution of biodiversity using spatial phylogenetics. Deep-learning approaches using repurposed digital images may also provide powerful new investigative tools.  Digitized data will be shared with iDigBio.org and other repositories.  A multi-pronged approach to broader impacts spans from K-12 to participatory citizen science initiatives.  These include (1) diverse digital, interactive, and object-based learning outreach programs; (2) online lesson plans; (3) science youth groups; (4) Science Clubs and public educator workshops; and (5) a series of videos using Learning Glass – which collapses the perspectives of viewer and presenter into one shared perspective. In addition, the PIs and collaborating institutions will host WeDigBio and K-12 clubs hosting label transcription crowdsourcing events during the award period. The project also partners with Zooniverse, leaders in online citizen science, where we will develop an online platform for citizen scientists to make observations on character traits that can then enhance metadata not always on the scientific label data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001428.xml,Digitization TCN: Collaborative Research: Documenting marine biodiversity through Digitization of Invertebrate collections (DigIn),NSF,2020-11-01,2025-10-31,288513,"For two centuries, America has amassed an unparalleled collection of specimens from exploring the world's oceans. They were pulled up with nets, scooped up from seabeds with grabs, and hand-collected by divers, all contributing to a library of biodiversity that captures the state of life in the ocean - year after year, decade after decade. The broadest evolutionary scope of those collections is in the marine invertebrates, animals without backbones - sea stars, corals, worms, jellyfish, crabs, and thousands of other animals. That library of preserved marine invertebrates is our essential guide to the diversity of ocean life across the globe. And because they encapsulate data from the moment they were picked up, these institutional collections also act as a time machine, letting us use the past to understand how our present will become the future. But there is a problem - vast numbers of these specimens are essentially invisible outside of a tiny community of museum specialists. The only record of these specimens' existence is on labels enclosed in the jars with the preserved animals or in paper logbooks on a shelf. These specimens will remain nearly undiscoverable on museum shelves until their core descriptive information is made digitally available. Therefore, this project will create public digital records for over 7.5 million specimens from our nation's legacy of marine exploration, thereby making the immense investment in the specimens' acquisition available to 21st Century biodiversity and ecosystems research. Because these specimens provide a visible and tangible window into our oceans' enchanting biodiversity, this project will involve STEM educators and student educators in the digitization effort, so that they will be able to reflect their science experiences directly back to the classroom. The public will be involved virtually, by contributing transcription of specimen label data. <br/><br/>Digitization of alcohol-preserved marine specimens has never been carried out on this scale. A major challenge lies in the location of the data: written, typed, or printed on labels in the jars with the specimens. In many cases, that will require opening the jar, extracting the label, and either transcribing it directly or photographing it for later transcription - for hundreds of thousands of jars. The immediate participants in this program will digitize most or all of the marine invertebrate collections at nineteen institutions across the country, more than doubling the number of digital records for marine invertebrates in the U.S. All data will be publicly available through existing data portals, including iDigBio.org, using standardized data formats, thereby dramatically enhancing the accessibility of biodiversity data for comprehensive, systems-based analysis of ocean ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2001570.xml,Digitization TCN: Collaborative Research: Mobilizing Millions of Marine Mollusks of the Eastern Seaboard,NSF,2020-09-15,2024-08-31,385509,"The Eastern Seaboard of the United States (ESB, U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone) stretches from the Canadian border on the Atlantic along nearly 6,000 km of eastern coastline, around the Floridian Peninsula, and along the Gulf of Mexico to the south end of the Texan coast, including 18 U.S. states. The ESB region is densely populated, with 47% of the U.S. population expected to inhabit the counties adjacent to the shoreline by 2021. Habitat loss, pollution, overfishing, and climate change threaten commercially and ecologically important marine species all along the ESB. This project will make occurrence data with map coordinates available for over 3,000 species of mollusks that find their habitat along the ESB, including mussels, clams, conchs, snails, and squid. Data from these ecologically and commercially important species (over 4.5 million individual specimens) will be made available through public online data portals. While the geographic ranges for many species of mollusks are well-known, the extent of their distribution within the seafloor habitats they occupy is unknown. Adding map coordinates to occurrence records for live-collected mollusks in natural history collections will provide detailed knowledge of distributions. Because natural history collections have specimens collected from the mid-1800s to present, these occurrence records can help track distributional changes over time and lead to better fisheries and conservation management.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One hundred million mollusk specimens have been documented in natural history collections across North America, and the breadth, depth, and growth of these collections is exceptionally well-known compared to other invertebrate taxa. Mollusks are among the best sampled group of animals, with some species having over 2,000 digital records available in natural history collections making them extremely well-suited for environmental and biogeographical studies that track faunal change over time and space. However, already-digitized mollusk lots are missing essential data such as collecting date (30% of records) and reliable georeferences (85% of records). This project will generate reliable geo-coordinate data for all covered specimen lots using a collaborative georeferencing project in GeoLocate.  GeoLocate will add layers for bathymetric data, benthic habitat, and marine conservation areas. Incorporating bathymetry into GeoLocate to determine the extent of locations will also provide that capability for complex elevational data for terrestrial species. Important trait data will also be incorporated. For the first time, molluscan occurrence data will distinguish between live- and dead-collected specimens, with a defined vocabulary for traits added to each record. Due to the long persistence of molluscan shells, the live/dead- collected distinction is crucial for all studies of biotic change using mollusks. Information on collecting dates will be refined where possible to increase resolution for detecting biotic changes. The data will be shared through public data repositories, including iDigBio, GBIF, OBIS, and the InvertEBase Symbiota portal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
