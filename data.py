        "abstract": "Operator theory and matrix analysis are both fundamental areas of mathematics. In large part, they were originally developed to provide a theoretical basis for quantum mechanics and other physical phenomena. An increasing number of application areas have emerged as a result of breakthroughs in operator theory and matrix analysis, which testify to their underlying importance to science and engineering. The areas of application closest to the research in this project are control systems engineering, electrical engineering, signal processing, image processing, and quantum computation. The principal investigator will build on his past work to further develop the interplay between the subdisciplines of free function theory, operator completions, statistical signal processing, matrix inequalities, and optimization. To accomplish this goal the principal investigator will continue existing collaborations as well as develop new ones, and engage actively with both graduate students and undergraduate students in the emerging research. The principal investigator will continue to maintain an intellectual environment fostering student involvement and development, providing the students with the skills, experience, and confidence to successfully pursue a career in the mathematical sciences. Thus, the project will yield both new, impactful mathematical results, as well as highly trained mathematicians prepared to join the scientific and educational workforce crucial to this nation.<br/>   <br/>Many questions in system and control theory, filter design, signal and image processing come down to function theoretic questions. The case of several variables is a highly active research area where the techniques of multivariable operator theory are highly effective. The specific themes of the current project include (i) Matrix completions, (ii) Moment problems, (iii) Free function theory, (iv) Realizations, (v) Determinantal representations, (vi) Numerical range and radius, and their generalizations, (vii) Hypergeometric functions, and (viii) Inverse eigenvalue problems. This combination of areas will lead to new avenues of research that are of interest to different research groups. All projects also have a computational component, allowing for the implementation of the results and the potential to be used by researchers in all areas of science and engineering.  The principal investigator will continue running an Analysis Seminar at Drexel University featuring local and international researchers, as well as Drexel students. The principal investigator and his students will disseminate the results via conference presentations and publications in a variety of leading mathematical journals and preprint servers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "Prevention, mitigation, and eradication of HIV has been the focus of governments, scientists, and public health professionals for decades. Recent reports, such as the “Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America” distributed by the US Department of Health and Human Services, have generated a renewed hope for the millions of people around the world affected by this disease. To achieve this goal, it is imperative to understand the most effective use of available resources in light of the new prophylaxis treatment and the continued improvements of the highly active anti-retroviral treatment, particularly in the case of non-compliance. A realistic mathematical model, including these two treatments, as well as disproportional effects on disparate subpopulations, is essential for effective resource utilization. The broader impacts of this proposal are far-reaching from a public health perspective, but will also serve as a platform to train primarily underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students at the interface of mathematics and medicine. This collaboration between researchers at Howard University, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and the National Institutes of Health will train students to work in a collaborative team environment focused on addressing a pressing scientific problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Realistic mathematical models can suggest best courses of intervention that can significantly reduce the number of HIV infections. The effect of the pre-exposure prophylaxis treatment (PrEP) will be included in a previously developed mathematical model of HIV. Previous models of imperfect vaccines have shown the potential for a backwards bifurcation that can dramatically affect the dynamics of the epidemic. As a result, the same intervention that brings a model without a vaccine to the disease-free equilibrium, could drive the dynamics of the model with PrEP to a stable endemic equilibrium. Transmission of HIV depends on the viral-load of the infected individual. Thus, realistic mathematical models must include the effect of non-steady highly active anti-retroviral treatment (HAART) through structured treatment interruptions, lack of adherence to drug regimen and drug resistance. Non-steady HAART treatment regimes and the subsequent two-way movement between virally suppressed and chronically infected will require using non-exponential treatment stages into the model, which will be fitted to publicly available Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) data from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Since public health data will be used in the mathematical model, parameter identifiability will be addressed structurally and practically. Several numerical tools for accessing structural identifiability of the model will be used. The profile likelihood method will be used to assess the practical identifiability of model parameters and to provide confidence intervals for parameter estimation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It is expected that the award will (1) further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, (2) improve research and teaching at the home institution, and (3) engage more undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in research experiences. The project from Bowie State University, a Historically Black College/University (HBCU), seeks to study the structural requirements for allosteric binders to certain enzymatic proteins that maintain protein homeostasis in mammalian, yeast, and plant cells.  The project integrates computational chemistry and biology with analogous bench research.  In addition, it is designed to include undergraduate and high school students as active researchers. Collaboration and mentorship will take place throughout the project. The PI will collaborate with another researcher at Georgetown University, while the undergraduates will serve as mentors to the high school students under the supervision of the PI.  <br/><br/>VCP is an ATPase which plays a major role in the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS).  The UPS is responsible for degrading unfolded proteins through the proteasome in order to relieve cellular stress. Once tagged with ubiquitin, VCP translocates the proteins from the ER to the cytosol. VCP binders have been shown to cause an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins which ultimately leads to cell death. This is favorable when the system is being exploited to avoid apoptosis. Six-membered ring heterocycles have been shown to act as ATP-competitive binders and are therefore unselective.  Five-membered ring heterocycles bind to an allosteric site of VCP and are highly selective. However, it is unclear what the structural requirements for allosteric binders are. We propose the synthesis of imidazole compounds through a microwave-assisted multicomponent reaction in order to access a variety of imidazole compounds with numerous substitution patterns.  These compounds will be tested and ultimately help define the structural requirements for allosteric binding to VCP.  We will also measure the effect of these imidazoles on VCP activity and cell death.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "This project will use tools from analysis to investigate fundamental mathematical models for physical systems driven to equilibrium by surface tension effects. A complete mathematical understanding of these systems is useful in addressing biological and engineering problems of mechanical nature, as it allows investigators to obtain analytical predictions on the implied consequences of physical theories motivated by such systems. At the same time, obtaining such predictions requires one to address hard mathematical challenges, which stimulates the growth and development of new and useful mathematical tools and methods, thus advancing the field of mathematics as well. The project will also provide research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>A first series of questions addressed in this project concern the use of minimal surfaces as models for liquid films at equilibrium. The classical idealization of liquid films as two-dimensional surfaces cannot account for liquid films properties where the thickness of the film plays a crucial role (e.g., the relation between the stability of a given geometric film configuration and the size of the diameter of the film itself). This project intends to develop a model for liquid films as three-dimensional regions with a small volume, which was recently proposed by the principal investigator and his collaborators, and which is capable of explaining physical features not accessible by classical approaches. A second direction of investigation includes rigidity theorems for minimal and constant mean curvature surfaces possessing physically meaningful singularities. This project investigates the possibility of systematically developing them into quantitative almost-rigidity statements, and of extending their applicability to non-smooth settings, with motivations in the description of equilibrium configurations in capillarity theory and in the asymptotic behavior of extrinsic curvature flows. Finally, the vast reach of this circle of ideas naturally leads to an investigation of related problems for isoperimetric clusters, fractional perimeters and fractional mean curvatures, and for geometric flows and equilibrium shapes in diffused interface models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Subsequent meetings will rotate among University of Houston, Texas Christian University, University of Texas at Tyler, Baylor University, and Texas A&M University. The Brazos Analysis Seminar will bring together analysts at academic institutions within the South-Central region of the United States on a regular basis to communicate their research, with a particular emphasis on providing an opportunity for young researchers and graduate students to meet, collaborate and disseminate their work on a regular basis during the academic year. The format for the seminar provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and junior investigators to present their work, start new collaborations, learn about the latest developments in modern analysis, and to advance their careers.<br/><br/>The scientific topics of this conference series will  focus  on the analytic theory of  operator algebras and operator spaces and their connections to  harmonic analysis, ergodic theory, dynamical systems, and quantum information theory. These connections include free probability methods in the study of quantum groups, Fourier multiplier theory on noncommutative Lp spaces,  dynamical system methods and  K-theory methods in the classification of C∗-algebras and von Neumann algebras,  etale groupoids, and inverse semigroups. In each meeting, there will be three plenary talks given by prominent experts, six contributed talks presented by three experts from the region and three upper-level PhD students. The goal is to keep both early-career and senior researchers in south-central institutions abreast of the latest major mathematical developments in noncommutative analysis, and to enhance and advance research on related topics.

A good number of the issues the PI plans to address are a natural continuation of problems he has explored recently that keep progressing and diffusing through a wider mathematical community. The questions to be studied have a certain universality in the sense that the same paradigm reappears from geometry and analysis, to fluid dynamics and material sciences, to financial mathematics and, more recently, biology and stochastic geometry. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first project concerns compressible flow (for instance, a gas) in porous media, in particular when the flow has a \"history\" that clogs with time the porous media (the Caputo diffusion model). Some important aspects of the Caputo diffusion model are being studied by the PI and an advanced graduate student, in particular when it occurs through two media with different porosity (transmission condition). Related mathematical phenomena concern the saline flow through semipermeable membranes (where the salt can flow only in one direction through the membrane). Another case where the flow is induced by global considerations concerns the quasi-geostrophic equation: this equation describes the evolution of the temperature on the surface of the ocean, and here temperature is influenced at a distance though the atmosphere. In collaboration with a graduate student the PI is working on the time evolution of this process in the land-sea interphase. Another interesting problem considered is concerned with \"overlapping\" interactions. An example is the structure of pricing for buying vs selling of goods. There is an area of \"values\" of the underlying good where the two prices diverge, and one where they come together. Mathematically, these are very interesting problems concerned with the stability of the configuration, in particular for the edge dividing one behavior from the other in a nonlinear way. In a different area, the PI is studying issues of segregation and predator-prey models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF\\'s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation\\'s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The award to Lincoln University, Missouri, has potential broader impacts in a number of areas. The goal of this project is to study the relationship between dust properties and the interstellar environments.  The project is a collaborative effort with faculty at the University of Missouri-Columbia, involves undergraduate students in the research, and is developing three undergraduate astronomy courses.<br/><br/>While it is well recognized that both the Galactic interstellar extinction curves and the gas-phase abundances of carbon, oxygen, and other metal elements exhibit considerable variations from one sightline to another, as yet, most of the dust extinction modeling efforts have been directed to the Galactic average extinction curve which is obtained by averaging over many clouds of different gas and dust properties. Therefore, any details concerning the relationship between the dust properties and the interstellar environments are lost. By utilizing the wealth of extinction and abundance data obtained by the International Ultraviolet Explorer, Hubble Space Telescope, and the Far-Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer, this project explores the dust properties of over one hundred individual sight lines by simultaneously both fitting the observed extinction curve from the near-infrared to the far-ultraviolet and conforming to the observed abundance constraints. Thus insight into the physical nature of interstellar grains and how they are related to the physical and chemical conditions of their environments will be gained. The results of the research will greatly benefit the analysis and understanding of the previously acquired data from various space missions, as well as of future data obtained.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the structure and properties of the atomic nucleus, which is about 100,000 times smaller than the atom it lives inside, and the fundamental forces between the protons and neutrons that constitute the nucleus, has been made possible by quantum theory. In quantum mechanics, this information can be acquired by solving the Schroedinger Equation, which describes the properties of the physical system. This equation describes how protons and neutrons are confined inside a nucleus by the Strong Nuclear Force. This project will allow the development of sophisticated computer algorithms and programs in a parallel environment to solve the Schroedinger Equation for Helium-6 and Lithium-6 nuclei. These are each light nuclei consisting of six nucleons. The PI will mentor undergraduate STEM students at the Central State University (CSU), a historically black college. The students will gain practical skills in parallel programming and high-performance computing, while gaining confidence in using computational physics to study the structure of atomic nuclei. CSU students will learn the critical skills of computer programming and numerical methods by participating in this project, thereby increasing their qualifications for the STEM workforce or advanced degrees.<br/><br/>The Schroedinger Equation is often solved to benchmark and develop nucleon-nucleon interaction models in nuclear physics. Although the study of a six-nucleon bound state is computationally a challenging and expensive problem, its investigation provides insights into the rich structure of nuclear interactions. The main goal of this project is the numerical solution of the Schroedinger Equation in the Faddeev-Yakubovsky form in momentum space to calculate the six-nucleon binding energy and wave function. This project aims to implement the numerical solution of six-nucleon Yakubovsky equations in a partial wave decomposition by developing the relevant parallel computer algorithms and codes. This investigation will show how the full solution of coupled Faddeev-Yakubovsky integral equations in a complete six-body treatment can probe the modern two- and three-nucleon interactions. It also provides an in-depth insight into the halo structure of He-6 and also the ground state properties of Li-6. This project has potential broader impacts beyond nuclear physics. The existence of six-body bound systems in other areas of physics, ranging from atomic physics (exploration of Efimov physics in ultracold quantum gases) to particle physics (dibaryon resonance composed of six quarks), brings a broader application of the project and its outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Epistemic exclusion is the devaluation of certain types of scholarship that occurs when invisible biases in systems of evaluation are coupled with prejudice toward, and negative stereotypes about, historically underrepresented groups.  Because faculty members' career outcomes (e.g., promotion, tenure, and turnover intentions) are determined by how well they meet evaluative standards, bias in systems of evaluation that disproportionately harm women and faculty of color may impede their retention and advancement in academia. The project team will create and validate a scale assessing faculty epistemic exclusion. <br/><br/>Results of the project have the potential to benefit society by providing a tool that researchers can use to investigate epistemic exclusion in STEM faculty.  Advancing this line of research may result in potential interventions and policy changes at institutions of higher education that improve the retention and promotion of women and underrepresented minority STEM faculty at our nation’s colleges and universities.  There is a plan for dissemination to scholarly audiences through peer-reviewed presentation and publications in professional journals that will help inform the research and academic communities.  <br/><br/>This project is supported by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development. The ECR program supports the accumulation of robust evidence to inform efforts to understand, build theory to explain, and suggest intervention and innovations to address persistent challenges in STEM interest, education, learning and participation.
